  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This essay was presented as a dissertation
for the doctorate in Columbia University. It
attempts to explain the nature of the influence
of Platonism upon English poetry of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, exclusive of
the drama. Its method is purely critical. It
has not attempted to treat the subject from the
standpoint of the individual poet, but has tried
to interpret the whole body of English poetry
of the period under survey as an integral output
of the spiritual thought and life of the
time.</p>

<p class='c007'>In its interpretation of this body of poetry
the essay has aimed to see Platonism in its
true historical perspective, as it must have been
understood by the poets, either as a system of
philosophic thought held consciously in the
mind, or as a more intimate possession of the
spirit in its outlook upon life. The idea of
Platonism which these poets had was that
which Ficino had made known to Italy of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>fifteenth century, and from Italy to the rest of
Europe. Ficino saw Plato through two more
or less refracting media. To him Plato was
the “divine Plato,” the importance of whose
work lay in its subtle affinity for the forms
of Christian thought. He thus Christianized
Plato’s philosophy. But this body of thought
was that peculiar product resulting from the
study of Plato’s “Dialogues” in the light of
what latter-day criticism has named Neo-platonism,
or that new form of Platonic philosophy
which is expounded in the “Enneads” of Plotinus.
But more than this. Ficino endeavored
to reform the practice of love by the application
of the Platonic doctrine of love and beauty
to the lover’s passion. From his “Commentarium
in Convivium,” which he translated into
Italian, originate the various discussions of love
and beauty from the Platonic standpoint which
were carried on in dialogues and manuals of
court etiquette throughout the sixteenth century.
In this essay, consequently, reference
has been made to Ficino’s “Commentarium”
on the points involved in the theory of love
and beauty. The translations have been made
directly from the Latin version of the commentary.
On the more metaphysical side of
Platonism the “Enneads” of Plotinus have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>been accepted as representative. The translation
on page <a href='#Page_77'>77</a> is taken from Mr. Bigg’s “Neo-Platonism,”
and those on pages <a href='#Page_153'>153</a>, <a href='#Page_154'>154</a>, <a href='#Page_155'>155</a>
are from Thomas Taylor’s translation noted
in the bibliography. In interpreting the “Enneads”
I have accepted the explanation of his
system by Mr. Whittaker in “The Neo-Platonists.”
All the quotations from Plato’s “Dialogues”
are from Jowett’s translation. In
quoting from the poets the texts of the editions
noted in the bibliography have been followed
in details of spelling, punctuation, and the
like.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the preparation of the work hardly anything
of a critical nature was found serviceable.
In the notes to the works of the individual
poets several detached references are to be
gratefully mentioned, but no general appreciation
of the part Platonism played in the work
of the English poets was at hand. Mr. Fletcher’s
article on the “Précieuses at the Court of
Charles I,” in the second number of the “Journal
of Comparative Literature,” appeared after
this essay had gone to the printer.</p>

<p class='c007'>I should like to acknowledge my thanks to
Mr. W. H. Heck for his service of transcription
in the British Museum Library and to
Miss M. P. Conant for a similar kindness in
research work in the Harvard College Library.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>To Professor George Edward Woodberry I am
most deeply grateful for innumerable suggestions
and invaluable advice. The work was
undertaken at his suggestion, and throughout
the past two years has progressed under his
kindly criticism. But the help and inspiration
which I have received from him antedate the
inception of the essay, extending back to the
earlier days of undergraduate life. The work
is thus inseparably connected with the training
in the study of literature which he has given,
and his help in its completion is only an episode
in a long series of kindnesses which he has
been ever willing to show.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>I. HOLINESS</h3>

<p class='c013'>The fundamental doctrine of Platonism as
it was understood throughout the period of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was the
reality of a heavenly beauty known in and by
the soul, as contrasted with an earthly beauty
known only to the sense. In this the Christian
philosophic mind found the basis for its conception
of holiness. Christian discipline and Platonic
idealism blended in the “Faerie Queene”
in the legend of the Red Cross Knight.</p>

<p class='c007'>The underlying idea taught by Spenser in
the first book is that holiness is a state of the
soul in which wisdom or truth can be seen and
loved in and for its beauty. In the allegorical
scheme of his work Una stands for the Platonic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>wisdom, σοφία, or ἀρετή, and a sight of her in
her native beauty constitutes the happy ending
of the many struggles and perplexities that the
Red Cross Knight experiences in his pursuit of
holiness. The identification of Una with the
Platonic idea of truth or wisdom is not merely
a matter of inference left for the reader to
draw; for Spenser himself is careful to inform
us of the true nature of the part she plays in
his allegory. Una is presented as teaching the
satyrs truth and “trew sacred lore.” (I. vi. 19;
I. vi. 30.) When the lion, amazed at her sight,
forgets his fierceness, Spenser comments:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O how can beautie maister the most strong,</div>
      <div class='line'>And simple truth subdue avenging wrong?”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. iii. 6.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>When Una summons Arthur to the rescue of
the Red Cross Knight from the Giant and the
Dragon, Spenser opens his canto with a reflection
on the guiding power of grace and truth
amid the many perils of human life:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Furthermore, she is represented as guiding the
Red Cross Knight to Fidelia’s school, where he
is to taste her “heavenly learning,” to hear the
wisdom of her divine words, and to learn “celestiall
discipline.” (I. x. 18.) In making these
comments and in thus directing the course of
the action of his poem Spenser presents in Una
the personification of truth or wisdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he does more than this; he presents her
not only as wisdom, but as true beauty. Spenser
is so thoroughly convinced of the truth
of that fundamental idea of Platonic ethics,
that truth and beauty are identical, that he
shows their union in the character of Una,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>in whom, as her name signifies, they are one.
Plato had taught that the highest beauty
which the soul can know is wisdom, which,
though invisible to sight, would inflame the
hearts of men in an unwonted degree could
there be a visible image of her. In his
“Phædrus” he had stated that “sight is the
most piercing of our bodily senses; though not
by that is wisdom seen; her loveliness would
have been transporting if there had been a
visible image of her.” (250.) Convinced, as
Spenser was, of the spiritual nature of the
beauty of wisdom, he carefully avoids dwelling
upon any detail of Una’s physical beauty.
The poetic form of allegory, through which his
ideas were to be conveyed, required the personification
of truth, and the romantic character of
chivalry demanded that his Knight should have
a lady to protect. The progress of the action
of the poem, moreover, made necessary some
reference to the details of Una’s form and feature.
(Cf. I. iii. 4–6; vi. 9.) But in no instance
where the physical form of Una is
brought to notice is there any trace of the
poet’s desire to concentrate attention upon
her physical charms. In this respect Una
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>stands distinctly apart from all his other
heroines, and especially Belphœbe. And yet
Spenser has taken the greatest care to show
that the source of Una’s influence over those
that come into her presence lies in the power
exerted by her beauty; but this is the beauty
of her whole nature, a penetrating radiance of
light revealing the soul that is truly wise.
Indeed, when Spenser has the best of opportunities
to describe Una, after she has laid aside
the black stole that hides her features, he contents
himself with a few lines, testifying only
to their radiant brilliancy:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>“Her angels face</div>
      <div class='line'>As the great eye of heaven shyned bright,</div>
      <div class='line'>And made a sunshine in the shadie place.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. iii. 4.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In other instances he directs our attention to
the power which the mere sight of her has
upon the beholder. Her beauty can tame the
raging lion and turn a ravenous beast into a
strong body-guard who finds his duty in the
light of her fair eyes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“It fortuned out of the thickest wood</div>
      <div class='line'>A ramping Lyon rushed suddainly,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hunting full greedie after salvage blood;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Soone as the toy all virgin he did spy,</div>

      <div class='line'>But to the pray when as he drew more ny,</div>

      <div class='line'>And with the sight amazd, forgat his furious forse.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. iii. 5.)</div></div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Lyon would not leave her desolate,</div>
    </div>

      <div class='line'>And ever by her lookes conceived her intent.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. iii. 9.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The wild-wood gods stand astonished at her
beauty, and in their wonder pity her desolate
condition. (I. vi. 9–12.) Old Sylvanus is
smitten by a sight of her. In her presence he
doubts the purity of his own Dryope’s fairness;
sometimes he thinks her Venus, but then
on further reflection he recalls that Venus
never had so sober mood; her image calls to
mind—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“His ancient love, and dearest <i>Cyparisse</i>,</div>

    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. vi. 17.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>To behold her lovely face the wood nymphs
flock about and when they have seen it, they
flee away in envious fear, lest the contrast of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>its beauty may disgrace their own. (I. vi. 18.)</p>

<p class='c007'>By these dramatic touches Spenser very skilfully
suggests to his reader the high nature of
Una’s beauty. It has a power to win its way
upon the brute creation, and it has a severity
and radiance that set it off from the beauty of
physical form possessed by the wood nymphs
and even by the great goddess of love, Venus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most important consideration that bears
upon the question of Una’s beauty is found in
the method which Spenser has used to indicate
how the Red Cross Knight attains to a knowledge
of it. One reason why the people of the
wood, the nymphs, the fauns, and the satyrs,
were permitted to see the celestial beauty of
Una unveiled lay in the fact that through
their experiences a means was provided by the
poet to quicken the imagination into a sense
of its pure nature. But the Knight, though
he had journeyed with her throughout a great
portion of her “wearie journey,” had never
been able to see her face in its native splendor,
hidden, as it had always been, from his sight
by the black veil which Una wore. The
deep conceit which Spenser here uses points
in the direction of Platonism; for there it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>was taught that wisdom could be seen only
by the soul. This is a fundamental truth,
present everywhere in Plato, in the vision of
beauty that rises before the mind at the end
of the dialectic of the “Symposium,” in the
species of divine fury that accompanies the
recollection of the ideal world in the presence
of a beautiful object, as analyzed in the
“Phædrus,” and in the “Hymn of the Dialectic”
in the “Republic” by which the soul
rises to a sight of the good. (VII. 532.) In
the “Phædo” the function of philosophy is
explained to lie in the exercise by the soul of
this power of spiritual contemplation of true
existence. (82, 83.) In Spenser this conception
is further illustrated by the part which
the schooling, received by the Red Cross Knight
on the Mount of Contemplation, played in the
perfection of his mental vision. Up to the
time when the Knight comes to the Mount
he is, as the aged sire says, a “man of earth,”
and his spirit needs to be purified of all the
grossness of sense. (I. x. 52.) When this has
been accomplished, the Knight is prepared to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in24'>“see the way,</div>
      <div class='line'>That never yet was seene of Faeries sonne.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. x. 52.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>While on this Mount he is initiated into a
knowledge of the glories of the Heavenly
Jerusalem, and through this experience he is
made aware of the relative insignificance of
that beauty which he had thought the greatest
to be known on earth. He thus says to
the aged man, Heavenly Contemplation, who
has revealed this vision to him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Till now, said then the knight, I weened well,</div>
      <div class='line'>That great <i>Cleopolis</i>, where I have beene,</div>
      <div class='line'>In which that fairest <i>Faerie Queene</i> doth dwell,</div>
      <div class='line'>The fairest Citie was, that might be seene;</div>
      <div class='line'>And that bright towre all built of christall cleene,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Panthea</i>, seemd the brightest thing, that was:</div>
      <div class='line'>But now by proofe all otherwise I weene;</div>
      <div class='line'>For this great Citie that does far surpas,</div>
      <div class='line'>And this bright Angels towre quite dims that towre of glas.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. x. 58.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>With his soul filled with the radiance of this
vision of beauty, his eyes dazed—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Through passing brightnesse, which did quite confound</div>

      <div class='line'>So darke are earthly things compard to things divine—”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. x. 67.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>the Red Cross Knight descends from the Mount;
and when after the completion of his labors he
sees Una on the day of her betrothal, he wonders
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>at a beauty in her which he has never
before seen. Una has now laid aside her black
veil, and shines upon him in the native undimmed
splendor of truth.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The blazing brightnesse of her beauties beame,</div>
      <div class='line'>And glorious light of her sunshyny face</div>
      <div class='line'>To tell, were as to strive against the streame.</div>

      <div class='line'>Did wonder much at her celestiall sight:</div>
      <div class='line'>Oft had he seene her faire, but never so faire dight.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. xii. 23.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The contribution of Platonism to the formation
of the ideal of holiness can now be
easily recognized. The discipline of the Red
Cross Knight in the House of Holiness is twofold.
In the practice of the Christian graces—faith,
hope, and charity—the Knight is perfected
in the way of the righteous life. He is
a penitent seeking to cleanse his soul of the
infection of sin. On the Mount of Heavenly
Contemplation he exercises his soul in the contemplative
vision of the eternal world. But the
emphasis laid by Platonism upon the loveliness
of that wisdom which is the object of contemplation
results in quickening the imagination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>and in stirring the soul to realize the principle
in love. This is the exact nature of the experience
of the Red Cross Knight at the end
of his journey. On the Mount of Heavenly
Contemplation he has a desire to remain in the
peaceful contemplation of heaven:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O let me not (quoth he) then turne againe</div>
      <div class='line'>Backe to the world, whose joyes so fruitlesse are;</div>
      <div class='line'>But let me here for aye in peace remaine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or streight way on that last long voyage fare,</div>
      <div class='line'>That nothing may my present hope empare.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. x. 63.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>But the aged sire, Heavenly Contemplation,
reminds him of his duty to free Una’s parents
from the dragon. (I. x. 63.) Obedient but still
purposing to return to the contemplative life
(I. x. 64.), the Knight descends; and in the
performance of his duty he gains the reward
that the contemplative life brings. “But he,”
says Plato, “whose initiation is recent, and who
has been the spectator of many glories in the
other world, is amazed when he sees any one having
a godlike face or any bodily form which is
the expression of divine beauty.” (“Phædrus,”
251.) Thus it is that the Red Cross Knight</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Did wonder much at her celestiall sight.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. xii. 23.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>With that sight comes the one joy of his life
after the many struggles experienced in the
perfection of his soul in holiness.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And ever, when his eye did her behold,</div>
      <div class='line'>His heart did seeme to melt in pleasures manifold.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. xii. 40.)</div></div>
</div>

<h3 class='c012'>II. TEMPERANCE</h3>

<p class='c013'>The spiritual welfare of the soul was the
prime object of importance to the Christian.
Through the power of its doctrine of heavenly
beauty Platonism had entered into the conception
of this life considered in its heavenward
aspect. It remained to show how it
could explain the right manner of conduct for
the soul in the presence of those strong passions
which were felt as the disturbing elements
of its inner welfare. In the Platonic
system of morality there was a conception of
temperance, σωφροσύνη, based upon an analysis
of the soul sufficiently comprehensive to cover
the entire scope of its activities; in fact, temperance
was there conceived as the necessary
condition for the presence of any virtue in the
soul. The vitality of this teaching in English
poetry is found in the second book of Spenser’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“Faerie Queene,” celebrating the exploits of
the knight Guyon,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In whom great rule of Temp’raunce goodly doth appeare.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(Introd., stz. 5.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The adventures of Guyon, through the discipline
of which he perfects himself in temperance,
fall into two distinct groups. Up to the
sixth book the conflicts in which he is concerned
are those calculated to try his mastery of the
angry impulses of his nature. After the sixth
book his struggles record his proficiency in
governing the sensual desires of appetite. This
division is made in accordance with the analysis
of the soul on which Plato bases his doctrine of
temperance. Within the soul are three distinct
principles,—one rational and two irrational.
The irrational principles are, first, the irascible
impulse of spirit (θυμός) with which a man is
angry and, second, the appetitive instinct the
workings of which are manifested in all the sensual
gratifications of the body, and in the love
of wealth. The rational principle is that of
reason by which a man learns truth. (“Republic,”
IX. 580, 581.) Against this one rational
principle the two irrational impulses are constantly
insurgent, and temperance is that harmony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>or order resulting in the soul when the
rational principle rules and the two irrational
principles are obedient to its sovereignty.
“And would you not say,” asks Socrates,
“that he is temperate who has these same elements
in friendly harmony, in whom the one
ruling principle of reason, and the two subject
ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that
reason ought to rule, and do not rebel?”
(“Republic,” IV. 442.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The rule of right reason in Guyon over his
angry impulses is recorded in three instances;
in each case the anger is aroused under varying
conditions. The opening episode of the book
presents Guyon checking the impetuous fury
of his wrath when he learns that it has been
aroused by a false presentation of the facts.
Archimago, the deceitful enemy of truth, related
to Guyon how the Red Cross Knight had
violated the purity of a maiden; and the pretended
maiden herself became a party to the
lie. (II. i. 10, 11, 17.) When Guyon heard of
this outrage he hastened to avenge the wrong.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He staid not lenger talke, but with fierce ire</div>
      <div class='line'>And zealous hast away is quickly gone</div>
      <div class='line'>To seeke that knight.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. i. 13.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>And yet he wondered how the Red Cross
Knight could have done such a deed. He
knew that he was a knight of honor and had
won glory in his defence of Una. (II. i. 19.)
He was quick, then, to restrain himself when
about to charge upon the accused Knight, for
on his shield he recognized the cross of his
Lord. When he was on the point of clashing
with his enemy, he</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in30'>“gan abace</div>
      <div class='line'>His threatned speare, as if some new mishap</div>
      <div class='line'>Had him betidde, or hidden daunger did entrap.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. i. 26.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>After an apology and an exchange of knightly
courtesies with the Red Cross Knight he was
able to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>“turne his earnest unto game,</div>
      <div class='line'>Through goodly handing and wise temperance.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. i. 31.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The second encounter of Guyon with the
forces of wrath is the struggle with Furor and
his mother Occasion. (II. iv. 3–36.) He has
now to try his strength in conquering wrath
when it has an occasion to be aroused. The
power with which he strives is described as
a fury of great might, but so ill-governed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>reason that in its blind passion its force is
spent to no purpose.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And sure he was a man of mickle might,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had he had gouvernance, it well to guide:</div>
      <div class='line'>But when the franticke fit inflamd his spright,</div>
      <div class='line'>His force was vaine, and strooke more often wide,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then at the aymed marke which he had eide:</div>
      <div class='line'>And oft himselfe he chaunst to hurt unwares,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whilst reason blent through passion, nought descride,</div>
      <div class='line'>But as a blindfold Bull at randon fares,</div>
      <div class='line'>And where he hits, nought knowes, and whom he hurts nought cares.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. iv. 7.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Guyon struggles with this madman and
finally, after he has quieted the reviling tongue
of Occasion, who urges her son, Furor, on to
the conflict, he binds him with iron chains.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In his strong armes he stiffely him embraste,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who him gainstriving, nought at all prevaild:</div>
      <div class='line'>For all his power was utterly defaste,</div>
      <div class='line'>And furious fits at earst quite weren quaild:</div>
      <div class='line'>Oft he re’nforst, and oft his forces fayld,</div>

    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. iv. 14.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The third trial of Guyon’s reason is by a
species of wrath so wilfully furious that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>runs to seek an occasion for a quarrel, and
finds no rest until it has succeeded. This type
of irascible impulse is portrayed in Pyrochles.
He delights in deeds of daring might, and in
blood and spoil. (II. iv. 42.) His squire, Atin
by name, acts as his forerunner to seek an
occasion for his lord’s furious delight. (II. iv.
43.) But Guyon masters himself both in his
refusal to fight for no good reason, and in his
behavior when forced against his wishes to a
conflict with Pyrochles. Guyon bids Atin
tell his master that he, Guyon, has bound
Occasion, and the Palmer, who is the rational
element of Guyon personified, lectures the
squire on the folly of wilful anger.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Even when Guyon is compelled by Pyrochles
to the fight, the Knight does not give way to
unrestrained wrath, but ever tempers his passion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>with reason. In the conflict Pyrochles
thundered blows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But <i>Guyon</i>, in the heat of all his strife,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was warie wise, and closely did awayt</div>
      <div class='line'>Avauntage, whilest his foe did rage most rife.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. v. 9.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>When at last Guyon has his foe at his feet, he
spares his life, so firmly he holds his passion in
check.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Eftsoones his cruell hand Sir <i>Guyon</i> stayd,</div>

    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. v. 13.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Thus far Guyon’s life has exemplified the
rule of reason over the irrational element of
wrath; the remaining episodes of his life centre
about the struggle of the irrational element of
appetite. In this his soul is tried in three
various forms of sensual desire. In Phædria
the first form is typified. She represents the
light gaieties of frivolous mirth and wantonness
which the courteous nature of Guyon may
suffer to play until they pass the bounds of
modesty. (II. vi. 21.) When, however, she
tried to win his heart from warlike enterprise
into dissolute delights of sense, Guyon</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“was wise, and warie of her will,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ever held his hand upon his hart:</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet would not seeme so rude, and thewed ill,</div>
      <div class='line'>As to despise so courteous seeming part,</div>

      <div class='line'>And ever her desired to depart.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. vi. 26.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The second trial of Guyon’s temperance comes
in the House of Mammon, where he triumphs
over sensual desire in the form of covetousness.
Mammon offers him mountains of gold,
if he will but serve him (II. vii. 9.); he tries to
induce him to accept by saying that money is
the one necessity to supply all the wants of man.
(II. vii. 11.) But Guyon answers:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Indeede (quoth he) through fowle intemperaunce,</div>
      <div class='line'>Frayle men are oft captiv’d to covetise.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. vii. 15.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>When Mammon urges him to seat himself on
the silver stool in the Garden of Proserpina,
to rest awhile and eat of the golden fruit of
the trees,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“All which he did, to doe him deadly fall</div>
      <div class='line'>In frayle intemperance through sinful bayt;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Guyon</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“was warie wise in all his way,</div>

    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. vii. 64.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The culminating trial of the Knight’s temperance
is made in Acrasia’s Bower of Bliss.
Acrasia typifies that form of beauty that allures
the senses with pleasure, but ruins the soul
with its poisonous delight. (II. i. 52, 53.) The
only fear that she and the inmates of her bower
have is</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“wisedomes powre, and temperaunces might,</div>
      <div class='line'>By which the mightiest things efforced bin.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. xii. 43.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>During the passage to this place of delight,
and while he was within its precincts, Guyon
was able to withstand every assault of sensual
desire upon his soul. When the Palmer, speaking
as reason dictated, told him that the piteous
cry of a woman in distress was only a deceitful
ruse to win him to harm—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The knight was ruled, and the Boatman strayt</div>
      <div class='line'>Held on his course with stayed stedfastnesse.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. xii. 28, 29.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Again, when Guyon’s senses are “softly tickled”
by the rare melody of the mermaids, as it mingled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>with the strange harmony of the rolling
sea, he bids the boatman row easily.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But him the Palmer from that vanity,</div>
      <div class='line'>With temperate advice discounselled,</div>
      <div class='line'>That they it past.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. xii. 34.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Even when Guyon began to lessen his pace at
the sight of the fair maidens sporting in the
lake, which kindled signs of lust in his countenance,
his reason was able to resist.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“On which when gazing him the Palmer saw,</div>
      <div class='line'>He much rebukt those wandring eyes of his,</div>
      <div class='line'>And counseld well, him forward thence did draw.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. xii. 69.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>He has now become so strong that he can
perform the great object of his adventures,
the destruction of the Bower of Bliss and the
capture of the enchantress, Acrasia. (II. xii.
83, 84.)</p>

<p class='c007'>So powerful is the hold on Spenser’s mind of
this Platonic conception of the nature of the
struggle in the soul striving to be temperate
that it colors even the Aristotelean doctrine of
the mean which is worked out in the episode of
Medina’s castle. (II. ii. 13 <i>et seq.</i>) According
to Aristotle temperance is a mean between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the excess and defect of pleasure. (“Nich.
Ethics,” III, 10.) In Spenser, Medina is the
mean; her two sisters, Elissa and Perissa, are
the defect and excess respectively. (II. ii. 35,
36.) Yet Spenser has colored the character of
each in accordance with the Platonic division
of the soul. The three sisters are daughters
of one sire by three different mothers; that is,
they are the three principles of the soul (the
sire); namely, right reason (Medina), wrath
or spirit (Elissa), and sensual desire (Perissa).
Thus Spenser describes Elissa:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“with bent lowring browes, as she would threat,</div>
      <div class='line'>She scould, and frownd with froward countenaunce;”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. ii. 35.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>and Perissa</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Full of disport, still laughing, loosely light,</div>
      <div class='line'>And quite contrary to her sisters kind;</div>
      <div class='line'>No measure in her mood, no rule of right,</div>
      <div class='line'>But poured out in pleasure and delight.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. ii. 36.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>So, too, in the description of the lovers of
each, the presence of the two irrational principles
is felt. In Hudibras, the devoted Knight
of Elissa—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“not so good of deedes, as great of name,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which he by many rash adventures wan,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>       ·       ·       ·       ·       ·</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>More huge in strength, then wise in workes he was,</div>
      <div class='line'>And reason with foole-hardize over ran,”—</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. ii. 17.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>the angry impulse of the soul is reflected; while
in Sans Loy, the lover of Perissa, who had
attempted to violate the purity of Una,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The most unruly, and the boldest boy,</div>
      <div class='line'>That ever warlike weapons menaged,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to all lawlesse lust encouraged,”—</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. ii. 18.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>it is apparent that the appetitive element of the
soul is figured. Temperance, then, according
to Spenser, is not the golden mean between the
excess and defect of pleasure, but between two
disturbing passions.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But temperance (said he) with golden squire</div>
      <div class='line'>Betwixt them both can measure out a meane,</div>
      <div class='line'>Neither to melt in pleasures whot desire,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor fry in hartlesse griefe and dolefull teene.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. i. 57.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This struggle between the rational principle
and the irrational elements in the soul does not,
however, constitute temperance. That virtue,
or rather that condition of all virtue, is the
harmony and order resulting in the soul after
reason has quieted the disturbing passions, and
is conceived by Plato as its very health or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>beauty. “‘Healthy,’ as I conceive,” says Socrates,
“is the name which is given to the regular
order of the body, whence comes health and
every other bodily excellence....  And ‘lawful’
and ‘law’ are the names which are given
to the regular order and action of the soul,
and these make men lawful and orderly:—and
so we have temperance and justice.”
(“Gorgias,” 504.) The fruition of this idea
in Spenser’s mind is noticeable in his manner
of speaking about temperance throughout his
poem. Amavia had been able to win her husband
back to the ways of purity through wise
handling and “faire governaunce.” (II. i. 54.)
The Red Cross Knight mentions the “goodly
governaunce” of Guyon’s life. (II. i. 29.)
Spenser comments in an introductory stanza on
the Knight’s demeanor in pleasures and pains:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='attrib'>“And <i>Guyon</i> in them all shewes goodly maisteries.”</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The Knight and the Palmer move on in their
path of progress “in this faire wize,” that is,
in the ways of temperance. (II. i. 34.) When
Archimago meets Guyon, he meets</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Faire marching underneath a shady hill,</div>
      <div class='line'>A goodly knight,”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>       ·       ·       ·       ·       ·</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“His carriage was full comely and upright,</div>
      <div class='line'>His countenaunce demure and temperate.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. i. 5, 6.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The feeling of order is conveyed through the
movements of Guyon’s charger. The Palmer</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“ever with slow pace the knight did lead,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who taught his trampling steed with equall steps to tread.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. i. 7.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Medina, when she welcomes Guyon to her castle,
meets him</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Faire marching forth in honorable wize.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. ii. 14.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The clearest explanation, however, of Spenser’s
conception of temperance as the condition of
the soul’s excellence in the body is given in his
reflection at the opening of the eleventh book
of the second canto, which records the repulse
of the bodily senses from the dwelling-place of
Alma, or the soul. No war is so fierce as that
of the passions with the soul.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But in a body, which doth freely yeeld</div>
      <div class='line'>His partes to reasons rule obedient,</div>
      <div class='line'>And letteth her that ought the scepter weeld,</div>
      <div class='line'>All happy peace and goodly government</div>

      <div class='line'>There <i>Alma</i> like a virgin Queene most bright,</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>And to her guestes doth bounteous banket dight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Attempred goodly well for health and for delight.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. xi. 2.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After this examination of Spenser’s ideals of
holiness and temperance, it is clear why Platonism
as a system of ethics is absent in the
remaining books of the “Faerie Queene.” Spenser’s
avowed aim in his poem was “to fashion
a gentleman or noble person in vertuous and
gentle discipline.” Since he conceives of life
as a constant warfare with inward and outward
foes, his method of presenting his thought is
to send each virtue on a journey during which
it is to perfect itself by overcoming the vices
to whose assaults it is especially liable. This
plan is carefully followed in the first two books.
The allegorical scheme is unbroken; the personages
encountered by the Knights are objectified
states of their own spiritual consciousness.
In the remaining books, however, the allegorical
scheme has well-nigh broken down; and
the poetic method is that of the romantic epic
of adventure in the manner of Ariosto. This
change was due very largely to the fact that
after Spenser had completed his first two books
he had exhausted the ethical teachings of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Plato; and when he went on to his remaining
books, he passed out of the sphere of virtue
as taught by Plato into an essentially different
realm of thought in which the graces of courtly
accomplishment were dignified as virtues. He
tried to treat these later virtues of chastity,
friendship, justice, courtesy, and constancy as
if they were coördinate with the virtues of
holiness and temperance. But they fall into a
distinct class by themselves. They are the
ideals of conduct to be followed when man is
acting in his purely social capacity as a member
of society. They may be dignified as virtues,
but can never be coördinate with the
Platonic conception of virtue, which conceives
of it not as an outward act, but as the very
health of the soul when realizing, unhampered
by any disturbing influences, its native impulses
toward the good.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difference between these two conceptions
is strikingly illustrated by a comparison
of Spenser’s idea of justice with the Platonic
notion. According to the English poet, justice
is purely retributive, a dispensing of reward and
punishment. The education of the Knight of
Justice, Arthegal, by Astræa, is thus described:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>“There she him taught to weigh both right and wrong</div>
      <div class='line'>In equall ballance with due recompence,</div>
      <div class='line'>And equitie to measure out along,</div>
      <div class='line'>According to the line of conscience,</div>
      <div class='line'>When so it needs with rigour to dispence.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(V. i. 7.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In Plato, on the other hand, justice is the same
thing as temperance, an inward state of the
soul and the condition of any virtue. “But,”
says Socrates, “in reality justice was such as
we were describing, being concerned however
not with the outward man, but with the inward,
which is the true self and concernment
of man: for the just man does not permit the
several elements within him to interfere with
one another, or any of them to do the work of
others,—he sets in order his own inner life,
and is his own master and his own law, and at
peace with himself; and when he has bound
together the three principles within him&#160;...
and is no longer many, but has become one
entirely temperate and perfectly adjusted nature,
then he proceeds to act&#160;... always
thinking and calling that which preserves and
cöoperates with this harmonious condition, just
and good action, and the knowledge which presides
over it, wisdom, and that which at any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>time impairs this condition, he will call unjust
action, and the opinion which presides over it
ignorance.” (“Republic,” IV. 443.) Spenser
did not attempt to incorporate this idea into his
notion of justice; he had already exhausted it in
his second book, in his explanation of temperance.
Nothing was left for him to do but to
shift his mind from a conception of virtue as one,
to an inferior notion of virtue as a manifold of
personal graces. But in thus changing his idea,
he destroyed the unity of his work. In his first
two books he had explained how the soul could
perfect itself in the full scope of its powers;
and in doing this he had taught the Platonic
doctrines of a heavenly beauty and of temperance
as the condition of virtue in the soul.
Here lay the basic idea of his conception of a
gentleman.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But vertue’s seat is deepe within the mynd,</div>
      <div class='line'>And not in outward shows, but inward thoughts defynd.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(VI., Introd., stz. 5.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>This idea, however, is not felt as the informing
spirit of his books on courtesy and on friendship,
but appears only in scattered reflections.
In the later books the inferior conception of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>virtue is the controlling idea, and Spenser has
failed to harmonize it with his earlier and finer
one.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>III. CHASTITY</h3>

<p class='c013'>Although Platonism as a system of ethical
philosophy determined the structural unity of
the first two books of the “Faerie Queene” and
as a system ceases to be felt in the construction of
the later books, the purity of its ethical teaching
is present throughout the entire work.
The truths of Platonism were a strong influence
in moulding an ideal of noble love.
The cardinal doctrine of this ethical philosophy
was that true beauty is to be found by
the soul only in moral ideas. This conviction,
which was so powerful in ennobling the
Christian conception of holiness, was carried
over into the realm of man’s social relations,
and through the genius of Spenser made to
dignify the conception of human love, and to
inform with a profound spiritual truth the idea
of chastity in its broadest signification as the
purity of the soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>The influence of the ethical conception of
beauty upon the subject of romantic love is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>found in the work of Spenser. Although
Spenser’s mind had a strong bent toward
philosophy, so that it could interpret the very
spirit of Plato’s conception of wisdom and
temperance, it was still a mind in which the
genius of the poet was always uppermost. It
thus resulted that in him the teaching of the
beauty of moral ideas came to fruition in
ennobling the conception of human life by
an appreciation of the true beauty of woman’s
inner nature, her womanhood, and by a conception
of love that placed its source in the
reverent adoration of this spiritual beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The exposition of the true inward beauty
of woman is found in the “Epithalamion” and
in a minor episode of the “Faerie Queene.”
In the account of the dialectic, by which the
lover gains a sight of absolute beauty, Plato
has stated that at one stage the lover will
see that beauty of mind surpasses beauty of
outward form. Plato says, “In the next stage
he will consider that the beauty of the mind is
more honourable than the beauty of outward
form.” (“Symposium,” 210.) This idea lies at
the basis of Spenser’s praise of beauty in the
“Epithalamion.” In his marriage hymn he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>dwells in exuberant Renaissance fashion upon
the physical perfections of the bride, each detail
an object of delight to the senses. The
sight of such beauty amazes the beholders.
But after this is done, Spenser draws attention
to the truth that, although these perfections
that are visible to the eye may daze the mind,
there is a higher beauty of soul which no eye
can see. His admiration for the bride’s beauty
is then caught up into a more lofty pitch and
blended with his love of her moral qualities.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the “Faerie Queene” there is a less elaborate
example of this same appreciation of the
inward, unseen beauty of the soul. The contrast
is set up between the lively portrait of the
Faerie Queene on Guyon’s shield and the actual
beauty of her person, and then extended to a
comparison of this with the beauty of her mind.
Arthur has asked Guyon who is the original
of the portrait he bears on his shield and has
chanced to notice its great liveliness. Guyon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>does not answer directly, but breaks out into
praise of the Queen’s beauty. If a mere likeness
appeals so strongly to Arthur, what must
he think when he beholds the glorious original;
and though this is fair, the beauty of her
mind, if he but knew it, would arouse great
wonder and pour infinite desire into his soul.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>In the vision of this inward world of beauty
in woman’s mind, so Spenser teaches, begins
the passion of love. In the “Phædrus” Plato
has analyzed it as a divine fury, and in his
account he emphasizes the feeling of reverence
with which the lover gazes upon the beauty
of the beloved, seeing in it the idea of pure
beauty which his soul has beheld in its prenatal
existence. “But he,” says Plato, “whose
initiation is recent, and who has been the spectator
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>of many glories in the other world, is
amazed when he sees any one having a godlike
face or any bodily form which is the expression
of divine beauty; and at first a shudder runs
through him, and again the old awe steals over
him; then looking upon the face of his beloved
as of a god he reverences him, and if he were
not afraid of being thought a downright madman,
he would sacrifice to his beloved as
to the image of a god.” (“Phædrus,” 251.)
The habit of contemplating the beauty of the
beloved in reverent fear is characteristic of the
love which Arthegal feels for Britomart. So intimately
acquainted was Spenser with Plato that
he caught the spirit of his worship of beauty.
Disguised as Britomart, the virgin Knight of
Chastity, was, in her panoply of armor, her
beauty was not the object of constant sight.
On three different occasions, however, when by
the removal of some portion of it her features
shine forth, the impression made by her beauty
is that of reverent adoration. When Arthegal
chances thus to behold her, the sight is so
awful that he hesitates to press his suit for her
love, and only after some time does he venture
to win her affections.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>One occasion on which the spectators catch
a glimpse of Britomart’s beauty occurs when
she unlaces her helmet. The sight of her golden
locks strikes all with amazement; and though
there is a mingled feeling of surprise and curiosity,
due to the preconceived notion of her sex,
the feeling of amazement and adoration of her
beauty is expressly stated as consequent upon
this revelation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>A second time when her beauty is revealed

</div>

<p class='c007'>With this vision of the resplendent beauty
of chastity begins Arthegal’s love for Britomart.
It has been pointed out by critics that the love
episode between Britomart and Arthegal was
a suggestion—so far as plot goes—which
Spenser found in Ariosto’s account of the love
of Ruggiero and Bradamante in the “Orlando
Furioso.”<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a> But the great difference in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>poets appears in the contrast of the passionate
love of beauty revealed in Spenser’s poem with
the superficial delights of love as explained in
Ariosto. As has already been seen, Platonism
as a system of ethics disappears from the
“Faerie Queene” after the second book; but
so deeply had Spenser been impressed with
the worship of beauty characteristic of Plato’s
manner, that when he came to recount the history
of the passion of love, in his Knight of
Justice, for his heroine, Chastity, he centred
attention upon the feeling of awe and reverence
inspired by the beauty of chastity, and
intimated the sobering effect of this vision upon
the behavior of the lover. He found nothing
like this in the “Orlando Furioso.” The love
episode in Ariosto is thus briefly described:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Rogero looks on Bradamant, and she</div>
      <div class='line'>Looks on Rogero in profound surprise</div>
      <div class='line'>That for so many days that witchery</div>
      <div class='line'>Had so obscured her altered mind and eyes.</div>
      <div class='line'>Rejoiced, Rogero clasps his lady free,</div>
      <div class='line'>Crimsoning with deeper than the rose’s dyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his fair love’s first blossoms, while he clips</div>
      <div class='line'>The gentle damsel, gathers from her lips.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A thousand times they their embrace renew,</div>
      <div class='line'>And closely each is by the other prest;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>While so delightful are these lovers two,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their joys are ill contained within their breast.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(xxii. 32, 33.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Here is only the note of delight. In Spenser,
however, the dread awe aroused by Britomart’s
beauty restrains the passionate utterance of the
lover, and only after some time has elapsed, during
which the two have rested from the fatigues
of their combat, does Arthegal dare to make
suit to Britomart’s affections,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yet durst he not make love so suddenly,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ne thinke th’ affection of her hart to draw</div>
      <div class='line'>From one to other so quite contrary.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(IV. vi. 33.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The training afforded by the philosophy of
Plato in the realization of the true moral value
of beauty has a somewhat different result in
the work of Milton. Owing to his preconceived
notion of the moral inferiority of woman, Milton
does not permit his mind to dwell upon the
vision of beauty to be seen in her, as Spenser’s
chivalric impulses have led him to do; but in
Milton the flowering of Platonic thought is
found in a certain conception of chastity, which
teaches that love begins and ends only in the
soul. And yet the deep sense of beauty which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>he has, asserts itself at times even in spite
of his prejudices; consequently in his work
there is a wavering of mind between the conviction
that woman’s beauty cannot be the
expression of the beauty of a moral order, since
she is the moral inferior of man, and the more
chivalric notion that in her beauty lies the
inspiration of the soul to know goodness.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Milton the love of beauty is the conscious
activity of a contemplative mind rather than
the pouring out of the soul’s passion in reverent
adoration. About Spenser beauty lies
as a golden splendour streaming from the hidden
world of the moral nature; whenever it
shines upon the lover’s sight, it at once moves
him to silent adoration. In Milton, on the
other hand, beauty is an idea to be known in
the soul by him who seeks for it among the
beautiful objects of the world of sense; its
pursuit is an intellectual quest of a philosophic
mind. Writing to his friend, Charles Diodati,
he says: “What besides God has resolved concerning
me I know not, but this at least: <i>He
has instilled into me, at all events, a vehement love
of the beautiful.</i> Not with so much labour as the
fables have it, is Ceres said to have sought her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>daughter Proserpine, as I am wont day and night
to seek for this <i>idea of the beautiful</i> (hanc τοῦ
καλοῦ ἰδέaν) through all the forms and faces of
things (<i>for many are the shapes of things divine</i>),
and to follow it leading me on as with certain
assured traces.”<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The expression of this love of beauty is found
in Milton’s Satan. Abiding beneath the wreck
of his moral character, in spite of the perversion
of a malicious will, there remain in Satan a
deep sense of beauty and a contemplative love
of it for its moral quality. In a speech addressed
to Christ in “Paradise Regained”
Satan himself confesses this one conviction
of his soul. The contemplative love of the
beauty of goodness and virtue is the very
condition of his soul’s existence. Thus he
says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“Though I have lost,</div>
      <div class='line'>Much lustre of my native brightness, lost</div>
      <div class='line'>To be beloved of God, I have not lost</div>
      <div class='line'>To love, at least contemplate and admire,</div>
      <div class='line'>What I see excellent in good, or fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or virtuous; I should so have lost all sense.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. 377–382.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The honesty of this confession is not impugned
by Christ, although he exposes the hollow insincerity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>of the rest of Satan’s speech in which
these lines occur.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Satan lives up to his confession. The
power of moral goodness to hold his mind’s
thought by its beauty is seen in his behavior
in the Garden of Eden. He had reached this
place in pursuit of his revenge to ruin the
happy pair. As he gazes upon the beauties of
the garden,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“where the Fiend</div>
      <div class='line'>Saw undelighted all delight, all kind</div>
      <div class='line'>Of living creatures, new to sight and strange,”—</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(IV. 285–287.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>he at last catches sight of Adam and Eve, in
whom</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The image of their glorious Maker shone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Truth, wisdom, sanctitude severe and pure.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(IV. 292–293.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>On these he stands gazing until evening, and
at last breaks out into an expression of the
love which this vision of their beauty has
aroused in him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in30'>“the sun,</div>
      <div class='line'>Declined, was hasting now with prone career</div>
      <div class='line'>To the Ocean Isles, and in the ascending scale</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose:</div>
      <div class='line'>When Satan, still in gaze, as first he stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad:—</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>‘O Hell! what do mine eyes with grief behold?</div>
      <div class='line'>Into our room of bliss thus high advanced</div>
      <div class='line'>Creatures of other mould—Earth-born perhaps,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not spirits, yet to Heavenly Spirits bright</div>
      <div class='line'>Little inferior—whom my thoughts pursue</div>
      <div class='line'>With wonder, and could love; so lively shines</div>
      <div class='line'>In them divine resemblance, and such grace</div>
      <div class='line'>The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured.’”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(IV. 352–365.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At another time Satan is occupied in contemplating
beauty, but it is the beauty he sees in
Eve alone. Milton’s treatment of the episode is
characteristic of that wavering of his mind between
the two impulses—one to worship beauty,
and the other to teach that woman is the inferior
of man. The later conviction is expressed in
Adam’s words to Raphael:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For well I understand in the prime end</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Nature her the inferior, in the mind</div>
      <div class='line'>And inward faculties, which most excel;</div>
      <div class='line'>In outward also her resembling less</div>
      <div class='line'>His image who made both, and less expressing</div>
      <div class='line'>The character of that dominion given</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er other creatures.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(VIII. 540–546.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Thus Eve confesses that in Adam’s beauty, and
not in the image of her own soft feminine grace,
does she</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in28'>“see</div>
      <div class='line'>How beauty is excelled by manly grace</div>
      <div class='line'>And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(IV. 489–491.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Yet in the presence of Eve’s beauty Satan
stands lost in contemplation, made for one
moment good.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold</div>
      <div class='line'>This flowery plat, the sweet recess of Eve</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus early, thus alone. Her heavenly form</div>
      <div class='line'>Angelic, but more soft and feminine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her graceful innocence, her every air</div>
      <div class='line'>Of gesture or least action, overawed</div>
      <div class='line'>His malice, and with rapine sweet bereaved</div>
      <div class='line'>His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought.</div>
      <div class='line'>That space the Evil One abstracted stood</div>
      <div class='line'>From his own evil, and for the time remained</div>
      <div class='line'>Stupidly good, of enmity disarmed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of guile, of hate, of envy, of revenge.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(IX. 455–466.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Even here the idea of the inferiority of Eve’s
beauty enters into the description; but a few
lines below it makes itself even more strongly
felt. Because her beauty is without its power
to inspire awe and terror, Satan reasons that
she is the proper one to tempt.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>“Then let me not let pass</div>

    <div class='attrib'>(IX. 479–492.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In this contemplative love of beauty there is
present as a noticeable element the consciousness
in the poet’s mind of the moral significance
of beauty. In Spenser’s description of the first
meeting of Calidore with Pastorella, however,
the contemplative love of beauty so absorbs the
power of the soul that the lover and the poet
are oblivious to every other thought and silently
gaze upon the beauty of form present to their
eyes. Calidore sees Pastorella on a little hillock
surrounded by maidens, she lovelier than all.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“So stood he still long gazing thereupon,</div>

    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(VI. ix. 12.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>So Satan stands before the happy pair in Paradise.
His will toward them is far otherwise
than Calidore’s toward Pastorella; but his contemplative
love of their beauty is one in spirit
with the youthful lover’s.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>The most characteristic side of Milton’s
idealism, however, is revealed in his teaching
of the doctrine of chastity as the purity of the
soul. In the defence of his own life which he
made in “An Apology for Smectymnuus,” he
acknowledges an important debt in his education
to the teaching of Platonic philosophy.
“Thus, from the laureat fraternity of poets,”
he says, “riper years and the ceaseless round
of study and reading led me to the shady spaces
of philosophy; but chiefly to the divine volumes
of Plato, and his equal Xenophon: where,
if I should tell ye what I learnt of chastity and
love, I mean that which is truly so, whose
charming cup is only virtue, which she bears
in her hand to those who are worthy&#160;... and
how the first and chiefest office of love begins
and ends in the soul, producing those happy
twins of her divine generation, knowledge and
virtue: with such abstracted sublimities as
these, it might be worth your listening, readers,
as I may one day hope to have ye in a still
time, when there shall be no chiding.”<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Milton
was the only poet of his time who was able
to conceive of chastity as an “abstracted sublimity,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>known in and by the soul. In his
treatment of this theme, there are two phases:
one in which the enthusiasm of Milton asserts
itself in a positive way, and the other a conviction
of maturer experience, in which sin is
explained negatively in its relation to the
soul’s purity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fundamental idea of Plato on which
Milton built his doctrine of chastity is the one
taught in the “Phædo,” that every experience
of the soul gained through the medium
of the senses tends to degrade the soul’s pure
essence into the grosser, corporeal form of the
body. “And were we not saying long ago,”
says Socrates, “that the soul, when using the
body as an instrument of perception, that is
to say, when using the sense of sight or hearing
or some other sense (for the meaning of
perceiving through the body is perceiving
through the senses)—were we not saying
that the soul too is then dragged by the
body into the region of the changeable, and
wanders and is confused; the world spins
round her, and she is like a drunkard, when
she touches change?” (“Phædo,” 79.) This
appears in the “Comus” in a modified form,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>and constitutes the basis for Milton’s conception
of sin in “Paradise Lost.” In the masque
the idea is plainly stated by the Elder Brother
in his explanation of the doctrine of chastity;
and its workings are seen in the effect of the
magic potion of Comus upon all who drink it.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in22'>“But, when lust,</div>
      <div class='line'>By unchaste looks, loose gestures, and foul talk,</div>
      <div class='line'>But most by lewd and lavish act of sin,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lets in defilement to the inward parts,</div>
      <div class='line'>The soul grows clotted by contagion,</div>
      <div class='line'>Imbodies, and imbrutes, till she quite lose</div>
      <div class='line'>The divine property of her first being.</div>
      <div class='line'>Such are those thick and gloomy shadows damp</div>
      <div class='line'>Oft seen in charnel-vaults, and sepulchres,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lingering and sitting by a new-made grave,</div>
      <div class='line'>As loath to leave the body that it loved;</div>

    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 463–475.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>This idea, thus stated, is represented symbolically
in the disfigurement which the magic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>liquor of Comus works in the divine character
of the soul visible in the countenance.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Soon as the potion works, their human count’nance,</div>
      <div class='line'>The express resemblance of the gods, is changed</div>

      <div class='line'>Or ounce or tiger, hog, or bearded goat,</div>
      <div class='line'>All other parts remaining as they were.</div>
      <div class='line'>And they, so perfect is their misery,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not once perceive their foul disfigurement,</div>
      <div class='line'>But boast themselves more comely than before,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all their friends and native home forget,</div>
      <div class='line'>To roll with pleasure in a sensual sty.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 68–77.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The opposition indicated in the Platonic
doctrine between the senses and the soul is
carried over by Milton in his description of the
trial undergone by the spirit of him who strives
to be chaste. In Plato the fundamental idea
is somewhat different from Milton’s; for Plato
is concerned with the problem of the attainment
by the soul of pure knowledge, and he
means by sense knowledge not sensuality in
the restricted moral signification of that word,
but in the broader signification of all experience
gained through all the senses. Milton, however,
places a narrow interpretation upon the doctrine
of Plato. This is evident in his description of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>the attempt made by Comus to allure The Lady
to sensual indulgence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Comus endeavors twice to overpower The
Lady. He tries to tempt her to impurity of
conduct, and also seeks to blind her judgment
through the power of sense illusion. In this
second trial there may be seen the influence of
the Platonic notion of sense knowledge destroying
the soul’s purity; the first trial contains
the more narrow application of the idea of unchastity.
Milton himself calls attention to the
greater similarity of Comus to his mother, Circe,
the enchantress of men’s minds, than to Bacchus,
the god of wine. He is</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in30'>“a son</div>
      <div class='line'>Much like his father, but his mother more.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 56, 57.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In keeping with his character he tries to entice
The Lady to drink his magic potion. He reminds
her that about him are all the pleasures
that fancy can beget; he praises the marvellous
efficacy of his elixir in stirring joy within; and
pleads with her not to be cruel to the dainty
limbs that were given for gentle usage.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“See, here be all the pleasures</div>
      <div class='line'>That fancy can beget on youthful thoughts,</div>

      <div class='line'>Not that Nepenthes which the wife of Thone</div>
      <div class='line'>In Egypt gave to Jove-born Helena</div>
      <div class='line'>Is of such power to stir up joy as this,</div>
      <div class='line'>To life so friendly, or so cool to thirst.</div>
      <div class='line'>Why should you be so cruel to yourself,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to those dainty limbs, which Nature lent</div>
      <div class='line'>For gentle usage, and soft delicacy?</div>
      <div class='line'>But you invert the covenants of her trust,</div>
      <div class='line'>And harshly deal, like an ill borrower,</div>
      <div class='line'>With that which you received on other terms,</div>
      <div class='line'>Scorning the unexempt condition</div>
      <div class='line'>By which all mortal frailty must subsist,</div>
      <div class='line'>Refreshment after toil, ease after pain,</div>
      <div class='line'>That have been tired all day without repast,</div>
      <div class='line'>And timely rest have wanted. But, fair virgin,</div>
      <div class='line'>This will restore all soon.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 668–689.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>To this argument The Lady replies simply that
no real pleasure can result from mere physical
gratification, but only from the enjoyment of
the moral quality of goodness. Thus she says
to Comus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I would not taste thy treasonous offer. None</div>
      <div class='line'>But such as are good men can give good things;</div>
      <div class='line'>And that which is not good is not delicious</div>
      <div class='line'>To a well-governed and wise appetite.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 702–705.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>But when Comus reveals the more subtle
trait of his nature, the response which The
Lady makes rises to the height of the threatening
danger. The Circean strain in his character
is his power of deceiving the soul through
sense illusion, and his insidious desire to win
his way into the hearts of men by courteous
words and gay rhetoric. Thus, when he first
is conscious of the approach of The Lady, he
says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in28'>“Thus I hurl</div>
      <div class='line'>My dazzling spells into the spongy air,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of power to cheat the eye with blear illusion,</div>
      <div class='line'>And give it false presentments.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 153–156.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The effect of this sense witchery is seen in the
forebodings of The Lady’s fancy and in the hallucinations
that haunt her mind as she comes
within the range of its spells. She says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“A thousand fantasies</div>
      <div class='line'>Begin to throng into my memory,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of calling shapes, and beckoning shadows dire,</div>
      <div class='line'>And airy tongues that syllable men’s names</div>
      <div class='line'>On sands and shores and desert wildernesses.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 205–209.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>When Comus, then, begins to practise the more
dangerous art of this witchery, acting in accordance
with his confession of his manner,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“under fair pretence of friendly ends,</div>
      <div class='line'>And well-placed words of glozing courtesy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Baited with reasons not unplausible,”—</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 160–162.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>she responds to the attack with an account
of the great power of chastity. Only because
she sees that he is trying to deceive her judgment
does she deign to answer him.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I had not thought to have unlocked my lips</div>
      <div class='line'>In this unhallowed air, but that this juggler</div>
      <div class='line'>Would think to charm my judgment, as mine eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Obtruding false rules pranked in reason’s garb.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 756–759.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>She then intimates the power which the doctrine
of chastity has to overcome Comus, and
states that, should she attempt to unfold it, the
enthusiasm of her soul would be such as to
overwhelm him and his magic structures.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Enjoy your dear wit, and gay rhetoric,</div>
      <div class='line'>That hath so well been taught her dazzling fence;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou art not fit to hear thyself convinced.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, should I try, the uncontrollèd worth</div>
      <div class='line'>Of this pure cause would kindle my rapt spirits</div>
      <div class='line'>To such a flame of sacred vehemence</div>

      <div class='line'>Were shattered into heaps o’er thy false head.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 790–799.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>This vehemence of moral enthusiasm in Milton
is due to the conception of chastity as an
“abstracted sublimity.” He learned it, he says,
in his study of Platonic philosophy; but the
teaching of it as a positive doctrine applied to
human conduct is his own contribution, and
strikes the characteristic note of his idealism.
In Plato he found only the suggestion of this
teaching. It lay in that idea of the “Phædo,”
already explained, of the destruction of the
soul’s purity through sense knowledge. Milton’s
imagination, working upon this idea,
transformed it in a way peculiar to himself
alone. The pure soul, according to his belief,
has power in itself to change the body to its
own pure essence. The conversion of body to
soul, however, is not a tenet of Platonic philosophy
in any phase. It was the working in
Milton of that tendency, visible throughout the
poetry of the seventeenth century, to assert the
primacy of the soul in life—an attempt which
was made by the metaphysical poets especially
in their treatment of love.</p>

<p class='c007'>The statement of this theory of chastity is
explained in “Comus,” and its quickening influence
is felt in the very manner in which Milton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>refers to it. Before the Elder Brother recounts
the effect of lust upon the soul he explains the
hidden power of chastity.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“So dear to Heaven is saintly chastity</div>
      <div class='line'>That, when a soul is found sincerely so,</div>
      <div class='line'>A thousand liveried angels lackey her,</div>
      <div class='line'>Driving far off each thing of sin and guilt,</div>
      <div class='line'>And in clear dream and solemn vision</div>
      <div class='line'>Tell her of things that no gross ear can hear;</div>
      <div class='line'>Till oft converse with heavenly habitants</div>
      <div class='line'>Begin to cast a beam on the outward shape,</div>
      <div class='line'>The unpolluted temple of the mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>And turns it by degrees to the soul’s essence,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till all be made immortal.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 453–463.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This is the “abstracted sublimity” which The
Lady refers to when she addresses Comus. It
is a notion, a mystery, which he, standing for
the purely sensual instincts of man, cannot
apprehend. She tells him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thou hast nor ear, nor soul, to apprehend</div>
      <div class='line'>The sublime notion and high mystery</div>
      <div class='line'>That must be uttered to unfold the sage</div>
      <div class='line'>And serious doctrine of Virginity;</div>
      <div class='line'>And thou art worthy that thou shouldst not know</div>
      <div class='line'>More happiness than this thy present lot.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 784–789.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>So powerfully, indeed, has the vision of beauty
described in the “Phædrus” and the “Symposium”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>affected Milton’s own imagination that
he visualizes chastity much as Plato does an
idea; it is an idea not only known to the
mind, but thrilling the imagination with its
beauty. When The Lady is at first conscious
of the power of Comus’s magic to disturb her
mind with foreboding fancies, she invokes
faith, hope, and chastity. The first two are
seen as personages, but chastity only as a pure,
unblemished form.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O, welcome, pure-eyed Faith, white-handed Hope,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou hovering angel girt with golden wings,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thou unblemished form of Chastity!</div>
      <div class='line'>I see ye visibly.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 213–216.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The directness of this vision is like that of the
soul in the “Phædrus” when it sees the flashing
beauty of the beloved, “which,” says Plato,
“when the charioteer [the soul] sees, his
memory is carried to the true beauty, whom he
beholds in company with Modesty like an image
placed upon a holy pedestal.” (“Phædrus,”
254.)</p>

<p class='c007'>It is in the vision of this holy beauty as a
lost possession of the soul that the deadly pang
of sin lies. In Milton’s later work there is no
reference to the power of the chaste soul to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>change the body to its own pure essence; but
his mind still holds to the power of sin to dim
the soul’s lustre. This is strikingly exemplified
in the character of Satan’s reflection on his faded
glory. The one keen regret that he feels, in
spite of his indomitable will, is occasioned by
the thought that by reason of sinning his form
has lost the beauty of its original goodness.
Throughout “Paradise Lost” there is repeated
emphasis upon the faded lustre of Satan’s form.
The very first words that fall from Satan’s lips,
in his speech to Beelzebub, as the two lay rolling
in the fiery gulf, draw our attention to the
great change in their outward forms.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“To whom the Arch-Enemy,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold words</div>

      <div class='line'>Myriads, though bright.’”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. 81–87.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>And then, as Satan proceeds, his mind is directed
to his own departed glory.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

<p class='c007'>When the moral significance of this change
in his form flashes through his mind, Satan
then suffers the deepest regret that could come
to him. The episode in which he learns the
true effect of his sin is his encounter with the
angels, Ithuriel and Zephon. These two have
found him “squat like a toad” at the ear of
Eve, trying to work upon her mind while she
sleeps. At the touch of Ithuriel’s spear Satan
springs up in his real form. Ithuriel then asks
which of the rebel angels he may be. The lofty
pride of Satan is touched to the quick.</p>

<p class='c015'>Zephon, however, points out that Satan should

</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>In Milton, then, whether his mind dwells on
chastity or on the consciousness of sin’s effect
on the soul, it is to the vision of a world of
moral beauty that at last it mounts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The relation of these ideals of holiness, temperance,
and chastity to the Christian doctrine
of grace, which finds a place in the works of
these English poets, can now be clearly seen.
The ideals of conduct are essentially moral
ideals, and in the attainment of them the soul
lives its fullest life. “The being who possesses
good always, everywhere, and in all things,”
says Socrates in the “Philebus” (60), “has the
most perfect sufficiency.” According to Plato
the soul may realize perfect sufficiency of itself,
it is self-sufficient; but Christian theology
taught the necessity of a heavenly grace for man
to work out his own salvation. The two ideals
are thus distinct; and though the English poets
incorporate both in their work, the line of
cleavage is distinctly visible, and the doctrine of
grace plays no more than a formal part in their
exposition of the soul’s growth. In the “Faerie
Queene” and in “Comus” Platonic idealism
triumphs over Christian theology.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Spenser the adventures of Arthur, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>whom heavenly grace is commonly recognized,
have no moral significance in the progress of
the Knight aided by him toward the realization
of virtue. Arthur frees the Red Cross Knight
from Orgoglio and Duessa, but the Red Cross
Knight is, morally speaking, the same man after
he is freed as before; the adventure of Arthur
answers to no change significant in the moral
order of his life as this is revealed in holiness.
The realization of holiness as an intimate experience
of the soul is achieved only after the
Knight’s training on the Mount of Heavenly
Contemplation, which follows all his preceding
discipline in the Christian graces; for this has
left him a “man of earth.” In the legend of
temperance the efficacy of grace is no more vital,
and what is more, it is an intrusion upon the
moral order; it makes the soul untrue to itself
and all that we know of her. The logic of
Guyon’s inner life did not require that Arthur
should come to his rescue after he had shown
his ability to remain temperate under strong
emotion and in the presence of wantonness and
covetousness. His swoon at the end of the
seventh canto has no more meaning than mere
bodily fatigue after toil; morally, Guyon should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>have been only the stronger for his past victories
over his passions. Arthur’s entrance at
the eighth canto, consequently, is not required:
Spenser is only paralleling in his second book
Arthur’s advent in the eighth canto of his first.</p>

<p class='c007'>Similarly in “Comus.” When the younger
brother inquires what that power which The
Lady possesses to keep herself unspotted in the
presence of lust may be, if it is not the strength
of heaven, his elder companion replies:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I mean that too, but yet a hidden strength,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which, if Heaven gave it, may be termed her own.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis chastity, my brother, chastity.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 418–420.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>So The Lady herself witnesses, when in the
great crisis of her life she appeals to faith, hope,
and chastity; <i>if need were</i>, she is confident that
heaven would send an angel to her defence.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O, welcome, pure-eyed Faith, white-handed Hope,</div>

      <div class='line'>I see ye visibly, and now believe</div>
      <div class='line'>That He, the Supreme Good, to whom all things ill</div>
      <div class='line'>Are but as slavish officers of vengeance,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would send a glistering guardian, if need were,</div>
      <div class='line'>To keep my life and honour unassailed.”</div>

    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 212–220.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>And the Guardian Spirit, in whose parting
words is found the moral of the poem, explains
the same idea of the self-sufficiency of the
virtuous soul.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Mortals, that would follow me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Love Virtue; she alone is free.</div>
      <div class='line'>She can teach ye how to climb</div>
      <div class='line'>Higher than the sphery chime;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or, if Virtue feeble were,</div>
      <div class='line'>Heaven itself would stoop to her.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 1018–1023.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The theological doctrine of grace, although
maintained as a part of an intellectual scheme
of thought, did not enter into the inward life of
Spenser’s and Milton’s work. So sensitive were
they to the power of beauty that nothing could
come between it and the soul. To Milton beauty
wore an invincible grace, before which all must
give way. Satan recognized this when he was
confronted by the angel, Zephon.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“So spake the Cherub; and his grave rebuke,</div>
      <div class='line'>Severe in youthful beauty, added grace</div>
      <div class='line'>Invincible.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(IV. 844–846.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Nothing was more natural, then, than that such
a mind feeding upon Plato’s thought and learning
its great lesson of wisdom, that it alone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>is truly fair, should conceive virtue panoplied
in all the might of beauty. He thus could
teach in his “Comus” “the sun-clad power of
chastity”:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“She that has that is clad in complete steel,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, like a quivered nymph with arrows keen,</div>
      <div class='line'>May trace huge forests, and unharboured heaths,</div>
      <div class='line'>Infamous hills, and sandy perilous wilds,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where, through the sacred rays of chastity,</div>
      <div class='line'>No savage fierce, bandite, or mountaineer,</div>
      <div class='line'>Will dare to soil her virgin purity.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 421–427.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In Spenser beauty is not thus militant. When
the Red Cross Knight, eager to enter the Cave
of Error (I. i. 12), says to Una, confident in his
power,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='attrib'>“Virtue gives her selfe light, through darkenesse for to wade,”</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Una cautions him to stay his step while there
yet is time. (I. i. 13.) But it is just as true
in Spenser as in Milton, that beauty is an unerring
guide in life. Spenser responded to it
because he felt most deeply the power of the
soul’s affinity for it. Throughout his work the
influence of beauty upon man is constantly present.
Even though at times he seems to be
drawn to it by the subtlety of its appeal to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>sense alone, he makes it very evident that true
beauty can be found in the soul only in its
habits of virtuous life. Thus the witch Duessa,
when stripped of her alluring beauty, is revolting
in her hideousness (I. ii. 40; II. i. 22),
and Acrasia’s beauty only poisons the souls of
her lovers. (II. i. 54.) Beauty that is nothing
but a mere witchery of the sense disappears
into thin air when confronted by virtue in her
beauty. This is the lesson taught in the vanishing
of the false Florimell when the true is
placed beside her. (V. iii. 25.) The power of
this affinity of the soul for beauty, mysterious
as it is real, which Spenser’s work reveals, is
conveyed in a question from Sidney’s “Arcadia,”
where the spirit of the “Phædrus” is all
present. “Did ever mans eye looke thorough
love upon the majesty of vertue, shining through
beauty, but that he became (as it well became
him) a captive?”<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

</div>
<h3 class='c012'>I. HEAVENLY LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>Heavenly love, as conceived in the poetry of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, refers
to two distinct experiences. By this term the
poets meant either the love known in the soul
for the realities of the unseen world or the love
which God had shown to man in his creation
and preservation, and which man could experience
through the indwelling of God’s spirit
within him. In the explanation of the nature
of these two experiences the teaching of Platonism
played a very important part, directing
the course of that love of man for heavenly
things, and accounting for the presence of love
in the Godhead.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the discussion of the latter of these subjects
Platonism was able to offer two conceptions,
in which a rational explanation of God’s
love as revealed in the creation could be found;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>one presenting the highest reality as beauty,
the other as the good. The first conception
was present in its theory of love. In the “Symposium”
Plato had taught that love was a desire
of birth in beauty, and that the highest
love was a desire of birth in beauty absolute,
the ultimate principle of all beauty. (“Symposium,”
206, 211–212.) Christianity, on the
other hand, had taught that God is love. By
identifying the absolute beauty of Plato with
God, and by applying the Platonic conception
of the birth of love to this Christian conception
of God as love, God Himself was understood as
enjoying his own beauty, thus begetting beings
like to it in fairness. In Spenser’s “Hymne of
Heavenly Love,” this idea forms the first division
of the poem which treats of the love of God.
(ll. 25–122.) At first God is conceived as living
in Himself in love.</p>

      <div class='line'>His second brood though not in powre so great,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet full of beautie, next he did beget</div>

      <div class='line'>All glistring glorious in their Makers light.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 53–59.)</div></div>

<p class='c015'>After the fall of the angels God finally creates
man.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Such he him made, that he resemble might</div>

    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 116–122.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The second conception of the highest reality
as the good is used in a more general way to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>explain the reason of creation. In the “Timæus”
the Maker of the universe is conceived
as creating the world in goodness. “Let me
tell you,” says Timæus, “why the creator
made this world of generation. He was good,
and the good can never have any jealousy of
anything. And being free from jealousy, he
desired that all things should be as like himself
as they could be.” (“Timæus,” 29.) In Henry
More the idea is expressed in the closing canto
of his “Psychathanasia,” where he is accounting
for the creation. (III. 4.) He has words of
bitter denunciation for those who teach that
God created the world merely as a manifestation
of His power, His will. (III. iv. 22.) He
maintains the Platonic teaching.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When nothing can to Gods own self accrew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who’s infinitely happy; sure the end</div>
      <div class='line'>Of this creation simply was to shew</div>
      <div class='line'>His flowing goodnesse, which he doth out send</div>
      <div class='line'>Not for himself; for nought can him amend;</div>
      <div class='line'>But to his creature doth his good impart,</div>
      <div class='line'>This infinite <i>Good</i> through all the world doth wend</div>
      <div class='line'>To fill with heavenly blisse each willing heart.</div>
      <div class='line'>So the free Sunne doth ’light and ’liven every part.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(III. iv. 16.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>So closely allied in the English poets are
the teachings of Platonism with the devotional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>spirit of Christian love that in the same man
and even in the same experience the thought
can pass most naturally from a conception of
Christ’s love for God, as absolute beauty, to a
subjective treatment of it as a personal experience.
Thus in George Herbert’s lyric, “Love,”
the invocation is to the love of Christ for
God springing from His imperishable beauty;
but in the second division of the poem this
love has become a refining fire that can burn
all lusts within the soul and enable it to see
Him.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>The earlier conception of heavenly love,
as related to absolute beauty, is not, however,
the more important of the two themes of this
poetry. From the very nature of the love
itself, although it could be described in accordance
with certain Platonic conceptions, it could
not be the subject of a personal treatment;
it gave no sufficient outlet for the passion of
love. This was afforded only by that heavenly
love which is the love of man for the unseen
realities of the spiritual world. The full treatment
which this latter subject receives in English
poetry testifies to the strong hold which
the teachings of Platonism had upon religious
experience in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. Platonism afforded not only the
philosophic basis for the object of this passion,
but it also acted as a corrective tendency in
checking the influence of an alien idea, erotic
mysticism.</p>

<p class='c007'>Heavenly love, understood as a love known
in the soul for a spiritual, or as it was then
called, heavenly beauty, sprang out of the
treatment to which Plato had subjected love
in the “Symposium.” In English it appears in
two separate forms, although in both it consists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>in gaining a correct idea of the relation
of the beauty known to the senses as compared
with that known by the soul. The only difference
in the two expressions is that the object
of the passion is variously described.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Spenser’s “Hymne of Heavenly Beautie”
occurs the first form of this love. The heavenly
beauty celebrated in this “Hymne” is the Platonic
wisdom, Sapience, as Spenser calls it, the
same high reality with which he had identified
Una. (l. 186.) The subject of the love in the
“Hymne” is formally presented as God, who is
described as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“that Highest farre beyond all telling,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fairer then all the rest which there appeare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though all their beauties joynd together were:</div>
      <div class='line'>How then can mortall tongue hope to expresse,</div>
      <div class='line'>The image of such endlesse perfectnesse?”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 104–108.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Yet the real subject is the praise of Sapience,
to which somewhat more than one-third of the
“Hymne” is devoted. A description of her
transcendent beauty and her power to fill the
soul of the beholder with true insight into the
relative beauty of this world of sense and that
of spirit is the climax of the poem. Among all
the attributes of God mentioned, His truth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>His love, His grace, His mercy, His might,
His judgment (ll. 113–115), the greatest is
Sapience, who is described as sitting in the
very bosom of the Almighty. (l. 187.) The
fairness of her face, he says, none can tell;
no painter or poet can adequately describe
her; his own powers are so weak that he
can only admire, not presuming to picture
her. (ll. 207–241.) So completely, however,
does she occupy the field of spiritual vision
in the happy mortals that behold her, that</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Spenser, then, heavenly love is
the love felt in the soul when the sight of wisdom
in her beauty dawns upon the inner vision.
It is a love gained through speculation; and
though the object is conceived of as yonder in
heaven, it is still the beauty which is seen here
in the mind. (l. 17.) Instead of the poetical device
of the Mount of Heavenly Contemplation
used in the “Faerie Queene” to signify the refinement
of the spiritual vision necessary to the
sight of this heavenly wisdom, Spenser has been
able to explain in detail the way along which
the soul must travel to gain its goal. It is
the dialectic of the “Symposium” (211), the
progress through ever ascending gradations of
beauty up to the first absolute beauty changed
only in the externals as required by the
Christian conception of the heavenly hierarchy.
But throughout the long series of
upward stages through which his mind passes,
one may feel the quickening of his spirit at
the thought of the highest beauty, in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>lies the unity of the poem. In the contemplation
of this heavenly beauty the poem begins
and ends.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second form which the doctrine of
heavenly love assumed in English is found in
William Drummond’s “Song II—It autumn
was, and on our hemisphere.” The conception
of heavenly beauty is not the ethical notion of
Spenser’s “Hymne,” but a less stimulating idea
of the beauty of an intelligible world of which
this world is but a copy. The attraction in
this idea lay in its appeal to Drummond’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>peculiar imagination, delighting, as it did, in
the sight of vastness. The poem is an exhortation
to the lover, who is Drummond himself,
to cease his mourning for his dead love, and to
raise his mind to a love of heaven and of the
beauty of God there to be seen. The two ideas
which Platonism contributed are the notion of
an intelligible world above this world of sense,
and of an absolute beauty of which all beauty
on earth is but a shadow.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conception of a world above this world
was suggested by Plato in his “Phædo” and
explained by Plotinus in his Enneads (VI.
vii. 12) as a pure intelligible world. “For
since,” says Plotinus, “we say that this All
[the universe] is framed after the Yonder, as
after a pattern, the All must first exist yonder
as a living entity, an animal; and since its idea
is complete, everything must exist yonder.
Heaven, therefore, must exist there as an animal,
not without what here we call its stars, and this
is the idea of heaven. Yonder, too, of course,
must be the Earth, not bare, but far more
richly furnished with life; in it are all creatures
that move on dry land and plants rooted
in life. Sea, too, is yonder, and all water ebbing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>and flowing in abiding life; and all creatures
that inhabit the water, and all the tribes of the
air are part of the all yonder, and all aerial
beings, for the same reason as Air itself.” In
the “Phædo” (110–111), Plato lends color to
his account by calling attention to the fairness
of the place and to the pleasantness of life there.
Drummond has seized upon this idea of an immaterial
world where all is fair and happy, and
interprets it as the heaven whither the young
woman who has died is urging him to direct
his love. Thus in her addresses to Drummond
she speaks of the character of the world where
she lives.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>These shadows are worldly honor and fame.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this point the poem naturally passes on
to develop the second suggestion found in Platonism,
that the beauty of earth is but a
shadow or reflexion of the absolute beauty.
As was common in that time, this absolute
beauty is identified with God. Accordingly,
the young woman appeals to Drummond to
trust in God’s beauty, which alone can fill the
soul with bliss. If the power of earthly beauty—the
glance of an eye—can make him leave
all else, what, she asks, must be the love kindled
by the “only Fair”; for though the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>wonders of earth, of sea, and heaven are beautiful,
they are but shadows of Him.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>This “Song,” then, though drawing on a different
phase of Platonism—its more philosophic and
fanciful side,<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a> not its deep ethical truth—follows
the same order of thought as Spenser’s “Hymne,”
and like that presents heavenly love as a love
known in the soul and growing out of a correct
notion of the relative values of the visible beauty
of the senses and the invisible beauty of mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Drummond heavenly love is a progression
out of the romantic love of woman. It is not
explicitly so stated in the “Song,” but in a
sonnet, the subject of which refers to the young
woman of the longer poem, he writes:</p>

<p class='c015'>This is a note heard in other poets where
heavenly love is described as naturally growing
out of earthly love when the right idea of
the nature of the object of that lower passion
has been learned. Thus in Milton it is taught
that the love of woman must not be passion,
but must be a scale by which the mind may
mount to the heavenly world. The passion

hedges the presence of Eve—</p>

brow” as merely transported touch, in reality
the same feeling shared by the beasts of the
field. (VIII. 582.) Raphael, accordingly,
directs Adam to love only the rational in Eve’s
nature, for true love has his seat in the reason.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Phineas Fletcher’s sixth “Piscatorie Eclogue,”
where there is a long discussion on the
nature of love, human love is shown to be a
love merely of the passing charms of woman:
of her form, which will decay; of her voice,
which is but empty wind; and of her color,
which can move only the sense. (Stz. 20–22.)
No attempt is made to describe the nature of
the higher love, but a simple exhortation to
raise this love of woman to a love of the “God
of fishers” closes the account.</p>

<p class='c007'>Heavenly love, then, whether springing from
the desire within the soul to see wisdom in her
beauty, or from a desire to raise the mind from
a love of earth to the intelligible world, or
from the desire to find a worthy object in the
love of the rational in woman, when freed
from all the grossness of physical passion, is
a contemplative love of a less perishing beauty
than can be found on earth. And just as the
transition was easy from the love which God
himself knows to the soul’s love of God, so was
the change from the love of soul for a higher
reality than earthly beauty to the immortal
love of God for the soul. Thus in Sidney’s
sonnet the subtle change is effected.</p>

<p class='c007'>The appeal which Platonism made to the
English poets in its doctrine of a heavenly love
was through its power to stir the minds with
a deep sense of that beauty which God was
understood to possess. The application of the
principle of beauty to God resulted in a note
of joy and in an exaltation of soul in the religious
mind, which, after forsaking the beauty
of this world of sense, could enjoy the great
principle of beauty in the beatific vision of
God. Such a strain of joy may be heard in
Drummond, in John Norris, and even in the
quiet lyrics of George Herbert.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sight of God in His absolute beauty is
considered by these poets as the end of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>soul’s endeavor. According to John Norris

described either as a sense of eternal rest or of
eternal joy. In Norris’s “Prospect,” the soul
is preparing for the great change that will
come when it is free from the body; and its
greatest change is described as a sight of
“the only Fair.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The violence of passion in these poets is
absent in George Herbert, and even the
presence of the beatific vision, as a conscious
experience of the soul known after the long
travail of its search for beauty, is not in the
least discernible. Still, the conviction that
there is a higher beauty than that seen on
earth, and that in truth lies this beauty, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>felt beneath the mildness of Herbert’s devotion.
In two sonnets, which he sent to
his mother in 1608, he laments the decay of
any true love for God among the poets, and
contrasts the beauty of God with the beauties
of the amorists. To him the beauty of God
lies in the discovery.</p>

    <div class='attrib'>(“Jordan.”)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In that truth he found his beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'>Platonism, then, came as a direct appeal to
the religious mind of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries which was so constituted that
the element of philosophic revery was blended
most naturally with a strain of pure devotional
love. Although the ultimate postulates of
that philosophy were intellectual principles,
they were such as could be grasped by the
soul only in its deep passion of love for spiritual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>beauty. The condemnation which Baxter
passes upon other philosophies could not be
brought with truth against Platonism. “In
short,” he says, “I am an enemy of their
philosophy that vilify sense.... The Scripture
that saith of God that He is life and light,
saith also that He is love, and love is complacence,
and complacence is joy; and to say
God is infinite, essential love and joy is a better
notion than with Cartesians and Cocceians to
say that God and angels and spirits are but a
thought or an idea. What is Heaven to us
if there be no love and joy?”<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a> This desire of
life and love, along its upper levels of thought,
was satisfied by Platonism; it enabled the poets
to forecast the life of the soul in heaven, and
of its anticipation on earth as a love of beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a strong tendency, however,
throughout this period of religious poetry,
toward a phase of devotional love which may
be called erotic mysticism, or that love for
Christ which is characterized less by admiration
and more by tenderness and mere delight
in the pure sensuous experience of love. Contemplation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>of Christ’s divine nature as essential
beauty is totally absent from this passion.
Christ as the object of this love is conceived
only as the perfection of physical beauty;
and the response within the soul of the lover is
that of mere sensuous delight either in the
sight of his personal beauties or in the realization
of the union with him. This strain of religious
devotion is heard in Herbert, in Vaughan,
and Crashaw. In Herbert, who confessed that
he entered the service of the church in order
to be like Christ, “by making humility lovely,”—a
confession which breathes pure emotion,—there
was joined so sensuous a strain that “he
seems to rejoice in the thoughts of that word
Jesus, and say, that the adding these words,
my Master, to it, and often repetition of them,
seemed to perfume his mind, and leave an
oriental fragrancy in his very breath.”<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a> The
spectacle of the crucified Saviour of man was
especially influential in keeping this strain of
mystical devotion alive; and the minds of
these poets are continually dwelling upon the
beauty of his mangled hands and feet. In
a nature so eminently intellectual as John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Donne’s, this strain of feeling is still present,
and in his explanation of the grounds for such
a love is found an excellent account of its
varying phases. In one of his sermons he
says:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I love my Saviour, as he is <i>the Lord</i>, he that
studies my salvation: and as <i>Christ</i>, made a
person able to work my salvation; but when
I see him in the third notion, <i>Jesus</i>, accomplishing
my salvation, by an actual death, I see
those hands stretched out, that stretched out
the heavens, and those feet racked, to which
they that racked them are footstools: I hear
him, from whom his nearest friends fled, pray
for his enemies, and him, whom his Father
forsook, not forsake his brethren: I see him
that clothes this body with his creatures, or
else it would wither, and clothes this soul with
his righteousness, or else it would perish, hang
naked upon the cross;&#160;... when I conceit,
when I contemplate my Saviour thus, I love
the <i>Lord</i>, and there is reverent adoration in
that love, I love <i>Christ</i>, and there is a mysterious
adoration in that love, but I love
<i>Jesus</i>, and there is a tender compassion in that
love....” (Works, II. 181.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Whenever Platonism enters into this tender
passion it always elevates the emotion into a
higher region, where the more intellectual or
spiritual nature of Christ or God is the object
of contemplation; and it does this by affording
the poets a conception of the object of the
soul’s highest love, as a philosophical principle,
whether of beauty, of good, or of true being.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first way by which this elevation of a
purely sensuous passion into a higher region was
effected was through the Platonic conception of
the “idea.” Plato had taught that in love the
mind should pass from a sight of the objects
of beauty through ever widening circles of
abstraction to the contemplation of absolute
beauty in its idea. This can be known only
by the soul, and is the only real beauty. Spenser’s
“Hymne of Heavenly Love” is the best
example of the application of this idea to the
love of Christ. In this poem he sings the praise
of Christ as the God of Love. He finds the
chief manifestation of Christ’s love in his sacrifice.
At first he treats this as a spectacle to
move the eye. He dwells upon the mangling
of Christ’s body (ll. 241–247), and exhorts the
beholder to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in22'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“bleede in every vaine,</div>
      <div class='line'>At sight of his most sacred heavenly corse.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 251–252.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>But later, instead of calling upon the beholder
to lift up his “heavie clouded eye” to behold
such a manifestation of mercy (ll. 226–227),
he directs him to lift up his <i>mind</i> and <i>meditate</i>
upon the author of his salvation (l. 258).
Christ’s love then will burn all earthly desire
away by the power of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“that celestiall beauties blaze,”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(l. 280.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>whose glory dazes the eye but illumines the
spirit. And then, when this final stage of
refinement is past, the ravished soul of the
beholder shall have a sight not of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“his most sacred heavenly corse”</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>The “Hymne,” which celebrates the life of
Christ on earth as a man among men, closes, as
it had begun, with the mind in the presence of
heavenly beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Phineas Fletcher the term “idea” is not
used, but the habit of thought is identical with
that of Spenser’s. Christ is to be seen by the
soul, not in his bodily form, but in his “first
beautie” and “true majestie.” In the passage
where these expressions occur Fletcher is showing
the manner of the love we should bestow
upon Christ for that which he has shown to us.
He says that the only adequate return is to give
back to Christ the love he has given to us.
He then prays that Christ will inflame man
with his glorious ray in order that he may rise
above a love of earthly things into heaven.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Crashaw’s “In the Glorious Epiphanie of
Our Lord God,” the elevation of the subject from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>a sensuous image into an object of pure contemplation
is effected by conceiving Christ’s nature
as that of true being according to the Platonic
notion. The first image brought before the
mind is that of the Christ child’s face.</p>

Thus in “Psychathanasia” the advance is made

      <div class='line'>“Their eyes on Him, whose graces manifold</div>
      <div class='line'>The more they doe behold, the more they would behold,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Fletcher says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Their sight drinkes lovely fires in at their eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their braine sweet incense with fine breath accloyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>That on God’s sweating altar burning lies;</div>
      <div class='line'>Their hungrie eares feede on the heav’nly noyse,</div>
      <div class='line'>That angels sing, to tell their untould joyes;</div>
      <div class='line'>Their understanding, naked truth; their wills</div>
      <div class='line'>The all, and selfe-sufficient Goodnesse, fills:</div>
      <div class='line'>That nothing here is wanting, but the want of ills.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(Stz. 34.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Here the progression in the scale of pleasures is
from those of the senses to those of the mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Fletcher presents this union as even a
more intimate experience of the soul. His is
the most elaborate attempt in English poetry
to describe the nature of the participation of
the soul in the beauty of the ultimate reality,
according to the Platonic notion of the participation
of an object in its idea. After three
stanzas descriptive of the state of absolute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>freedom from cares of life which reigns in heaven
(stz. 35–37), Fletcher passes on to a description
of God—the “Idea Beatificall,” as he
names Him—in accordance with the Platonic
notion of the highest principle, The One:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In midst of this citie cælestiall,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whear the Eternall Temple should have rose,</div>
      <div class='line'>Light’ned the Idea Beatificall:</div>
      <div class='line'>End, and beginning of each thing that growes;</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose selfe no end, nor yet beginning knowes;</div>
      <div class='line'>That hath no eyes to see, nor ears to heare;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet sees, and heares, and is all-eye, all-eare;</div>
      <div class='line'>That nowhear is contain’d, and yet is every whear:</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Changer of all things, yet immutable;</div>
      <div class='line'>Before and after all, the first and last;</div>
      <div class='line'>That, mooving all, is yet immoveable;</div>
      <div class='line'>Great without quantitie: in Whose forecast</div>
      <div class='line'>Things past are present, things to come are past;</div>
      <div class='line'>Swift without motion; to Whose open eye</div>
      <div class='line'>The hearts of wicked men unbrested lie;</div>
      <div class='line'>At once absent and present to them, farre, and nigh.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(Stz. 39–40.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>He then goes on to explain what the Idea is not.
It is nothing that can be known by sense. It
is no flaming lustre, no harmony of sounds, no
ambrosial feast for the appetite, no odor, no soft
embrace, nor any sensual pleasure. And yet
within the soul of the beholder it is known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>as an inward feast, a harmony, a light, a sound,
a sweet perfume, and entire embrace. Thus
he writes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“It is no flaming lustre, made of light;</div>
      <div class='line'>No sweet concent, as well-tim’d harmonie;</div>
      <div class='line'>Ambrosia, for to feast the appetite,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or flowrie odour, mixt with spicerie;</div>
      <div class='line'>No soft embrace, or pleasure bodily;</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet it is a kinde of inward feast,</div>
      <div class='line'>A harmony, that sounds within the brest,</div>
      <div class='line'>An odour, light, embrace, in which the soule doth rest.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A heav’nly feast, no hunger can consume;</div>
      <div class='line'>A light unseene, yet shines in every place;</div>
      <div class='line'>A sound, no time can steale; a sweet perfume</div>
      <div class='line'>No winds can scatter; an intire embrace</div>
      <div class='line'>That no satietie can ere unlace.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(Stz. 41–42.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Such was the powerful hold of the doctrines
of Platonism upon the minds of these religious
poets. Strong as were the forces leading
them into a degenerate form of Christian love,
these were overcome by the one fundamental
conception of Platonism that the highest love
the soul can know is the love of a purely intellectual
principle of beauty and goodness; and
that this love is one in which passion and
reason are wedded into the one supreme
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>desire of the seeker after wisdom and beauty.
Such a conception saved a large body of
English poetry from degenerating into that
form of erotic mysticism which Crashaw’s later
poems reveal; and in which there is no elevation
of the mind away from the lower range of
sense enjoyment, but only an introversion of the
physical life into the intimacies of spiritual
experience.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>II. EARTHLY LOVE</h3>

<p class='c013'>The influence of Platonism upon the love
poetry of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
in England is felt in two distinct forms.
In the first place, the teachings of that philosophy
were used to explain and dignify the
conception of love as a passion having its
source in a desire for the enjoyment of beauty;
and in the second place, the emphasis laid by
Platonism upon the function of the soul as opposed
to the senses resulted in a tendency to
treat love as a purely spiritual passion devoid
of all sensuous pleasure. In the first phase the
teachings of Platonic theory were made to render
service according to the conventional love
theory known as Petrarchism; and in its second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>phase Platonism contributed its share in keeping
alive the so-called metaphysical mood of
the seventeenth-century lyric.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to the conventional method of
Petrarchism, the object of the poet’s love was
always a lady of great beauty and spotless
virtue, and of a correspondingly great cruelty.
Hence the subjects of the Petrarchian love
poem were either the praise of the mistress’s
beauty or an account of the torment of soul
caused by her heartless indifference. By applying
the doctrines of Platonism to this conventional
manner, a way was found to explain
upon a seemingly philosophic basis the power
of the lover’s passion and of beauty as its
exciting cause. The best example in English
of this application of Platonic theory is
Spenser’s two hymns,—“An Hymne in
Honour of Love” and “An Hymne in Honour
of Beautie.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The professed aim of Spenser in these hymns
differs in no wise from the purpose of the Petrarchian
lover. Both are written to ease the
torments of an unrequited passion. In the
“Hymne in Honour of Love” he addresses love
in his invocation:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“Love, that long since hast to thy mighty powre,</div>
      <div class='line'>Perforce subdude my poore captived hart,</div>
      <div class='line'>And raging now therein with restlesse stowre,</div>
      <div class='line'>Doest tyrannize in everie weaker part;</div>
      <div class='line'>Faine would I seeke to ease my bitter smart,</div>
      <div class='line'>By any service I might do to thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or ought that else might to thee pleasing bee.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 4–10.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In his closing stanzas he expresses the wish of
coming at last to the object of his desire.
(ll. 298–300.) In the “Hymne in Honour of
Beautie,” he openly confesses a desire that
through his hymn</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“It may so please that she at length will streame</div>
      <div class='line'>Some deaw of grace, into my withered hart,</div>
      <div class='line'>After long sorrow and consuming smart.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 29–31.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The only respect in which these hymns differ
from the mass of love poetry of their time
is in the method by which Spenser treated the
common subject of the poetical amorists of the
Renaissance. In singing the praises of love
and beauty he drew upon the doctrines of
Italian Platonism, and by the power of his
own genius blended the purely expository and
lyrical strains so that at times it is difficult to
separate them. The presence of Platonic doctrine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>however, is felt in the dignified treatment
of the passion of love and of beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the “Hymne in Honour of Love” love is
described as no merely cruel passion inflicted
by the tyrannical Cupid of the amorist, but as
the manifestation in man of the great informing
power which brought the universe out of
chaos and which now maintains it in order and
concord. According to Ficino, the greatest
representative of Italian Platonism during the
Renaissance, one truth established by the speech
of Eryximachus in the “Symposium” is that
love is the creator and preserver of all things.
“Through this,” Ficino says in his “Commentarium
in Convivium,” “fire moves air by sharing
its heat; the air moves the water, the water
moves the earth; and <i>vice versa</i> the earth draws
the water to itself; water, the air; and the air,
the fire. Plants and trees also beget their like
because of a desire of propagating their seed.
Animals, brutes, and men are allured by the
same desire to beget offspring.” (III. 2.) And
in summing up his discussion he says, “Therefore
all parts of the universe, since they are the
work of one artificer and are members of the
same mechanism like to one another both in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>being and in life, are linked together by a certain
mutual love, so that love may be rightly
declared the perpetual bond of the universe and
the unmoving support of its parts and the firm
basis of the whole mechanism.” (III. 3.) Holding
to this conception of love Spenser comes to
a praise of the</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Great god of might, that reignest in the mynd,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the bodie to thy hest doest frame,”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 46–47.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>with an explanation of His power as the creating
and sustaining spirit of the universe. Before
the world was created love moved over the
warring elements of chaos and arranged them
in the order they now obey.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Then through the world his way he gan to take,</div>
      <div class='line'>The world that was not till he did it make;</div>

      <div class='line'>Together linkt with Adamantine chaines.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 77–92.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The second subject which was treated in the
light of Platonism was that of beauty. In the
“Hymne in Honour of Beautie” the topic is
treated from three points of view. First, the
“Hymne” outlines a general theory of æsthetics
to account for the presence of beauty in the
universe lying without us (ll. 32–87); second,
it explains the ground of reason for the beauty
to be found in the human body (ll. 88–164);
and third, it accounts for the exaggerated
notion which the lover has of his beloved’s
physical perfections. (ll. 214–270.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Spenser’s general theory of æsthetics is a
blending of two suggestions he found in his
study of Platonism. According to Ficino,
beauty is a spiritual thing, the splendor of
God’s light shining in all things. (II. 5;
V. 4.) This conception is based upon the idea
that the universe is an emanation of God’s
spirit, and that beauty is the lively grace of the
divine light of God shining in matter. (V. 6.)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>But according to another view, the universe is
conceived as the objective work of an artificer,
working according to a pattern. “The work
of the creator,” says Plato in the “Timæus”
(28, 29), “whenever he looks to the unchangeable
and fashions the form and the nature of
his work after an unchangeable pattern, must
necessarily be made fair and perfect.... If
the world be indeed fair and the artificer good,
it is manifest that he must have looked to that
which is eternal&#160;... for the world is the fairest
of creations and he is the best of causes.”
By blending these ideas Spenser was able to
conceive of God as creating the world after a
pattern of ideal beauty, which, by virtue of
its infusion into matter, is the source of that
lively grace which the objects called beautiful
possess. At first he presents the view of creation
which is more in accordance with the
Mosaic account,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“What time this worlds great workmaister did cast</div>
      <div class='line'>To make al things, such as we now behold:</div>
      <div class='line'>It seemes that he before his eyes had plast</div>
      <div class='line'>A goodly Paterne to whose perfect mould,</div>
      <div class='line'>He fashioned them as comely as he could,</div>
      <div class='line'>That now so faire and seemely they appeare,</div>
      <div class='line'>As nought may be amended any wheare.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“That wondrous Paterne</div>

    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 32–45.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Spenser now passes on to the theory of the
infusion of beauty in matter, by which its
grossness is refined and quickened, as it were,
into life.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thereof as every earthly thing partakes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or more or lesse by influence divine,</div>
      <div class='line'>So it more faire accordingly it makes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the grosse matter of this earthly myne,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which clotheth it, thereafter doth refyne,</div>
      <div class='line'>Doing away the drosse which dims the light</div>
      <div class='line'>Of that faire beame, which therein is empight.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For through infusion of celestiall powre,</div>
      <div class='line'>The duller earth it quickneth with delight</div>
      <div class='line'>And life-full spirits privily doth powre</div>
      <div class='line'>Through all the parts, that to the looker’s sight</div>
      <div class='line'>They seeme to please. That is thy soveraine might,</div>
      <div class='line'>O <i>Cyprian</i> Queene, which flowing from the beame</div>
      <div class='line'>Of thy bright starre, then into them doest streame.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 46–59.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>At this point of his “Hymne” Spenser pauses
to refute the idea that beauty is</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“An outward shew of things, that onely seeme”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(l. 94.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>His pausing to overthrow such an idea of
beauty is quite in the manner of the scientific
expositor in the Italian treatises and dialogues
written throughout the Renaissance. Ficino,
for instance, combats the idea, which he says
some hold, that beauty is nothing but the proportion
of the various parts of an object with
a certain sweetness of color. (V. 3.) In like
manner Spenser says it is the idle wit that identifies
beauty with proportion and color, both of
which pass away.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“How vainely then doe ydle wits invent,</div>
      <div class='line'>That beautie is nought else, but mixture made</div>
      <div class='line'>Of colours faire, and goodly temp’rament,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of pure complexions, that shall quickly fade</div>
      <div class='line'>And passe away, like to a sommers shade,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or that it is but comely composition</div>
      <div class='line'>Of parts well measurd, with meet disposition.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 67–73.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Spenser overthrows this contention by doubting
the power of mere color and superficial
proportion to stir the soul of man. (ll. 74–87.)
He has proved the power of beauty only too
well to maintain such a theory. He thus seeks
for the source of its power in the soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Platonic theory of beauty teaches that
the beauty of the body is a result of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>formative energy of the soul. According to
Ficino, the soul has descended from heaven and
has framed a body in which to dwell. Before
its descent it conceives a certain plan for the
forming of a body; and if on earth it finds
material favorable for its work and sufficiently
plastic, its earthly body is very similar to its
celestial one, hence it is beautiful. (VI. 6.)
In Spenser this conception underlies his account
of the descent of the soul from God to earth.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For when the soule, the which derived was</div>
      <div class='line'>At first, out of that great immortall Spright,</div>
      <div class='line'>By whom all live to love, whilome did pas</div>
      <div class='line'>Downe from the top of purest heavens hight,</div>
      <div class='line'>To be embodied here, it then tooke light</div>

    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 109–136.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The obvious objection which one might make
to this theory, that it does not cover the whole
ground inasmuch as it could never account
for the fact of the existence of a good soul in
any but a beautiful form, was answered by the
further explanation that when the matter of
which the soul makes its body is unyielding,
the soul must content itself with a less beautiful
form. (Ficino, VI. 6.) Thus Spenser
adds:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yet oft it falles, that many a gentle mynd</div>
      <div class='line'>Dwels in deformed tabernacle drownd,</div>
      <div class='line'>Either by chaunce, against the course of kynd,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or through unaptnesse in the substance sownd,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which it assumed of some stubborne grownd,</div>
      <div class='line'>That will not yield unto her formes direction,</div>
      <div class='line'>But is perform’d with some foule imperfection.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 144–150.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After an exhortation to the “faire Dames”
to keep their souls unspotted (ll. 165–200),
Spenser outlines the true manner of love and in
the course of his poem he accounts for that manifestation
of power which the beloved’s beauty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>has over the mind of the lover. According to
Ficino, true lovers are those whose souls have
departed from heaven under the same astral
influences and who, accordingly, are informed
with the same idea in imitation of which they
frame their earthly bodies. (VI. 6.) Thus
Spenser writes that love is not a matter of
chance, but a union of souls ordained by
heaven.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For Love is a celestiall harmonie,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of likely harts composd of starres concent,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which joyne together in sweet sympathie,</div>
      <div class='line'>To work ech others joy and true content,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which they have harbourd since their first descent</div>
      <div class='line'>Out of their heavenly bowres, where they did see</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Then wrong it were that any other twaine</div>

      <div class='line'>But those whom heaven did at first ordaine,</div>
      <div class='line'>And made out of one mould the more t’ agree:</div>
      <div class='line'>For all that like the beautie which they see,</div>
      <div class='line'>Streight do not love: for love is not so light,</div>
      <div class='line'>As straight to burne at first beholders sight.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 200–213.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>He then explains the Platonist’s views of
love as a passion. Ficino had stated that the
lover is not satisfied with the mere visual image
of the beloved, but refashions it in accordance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>with the idea of the beloved which he has;
for the two souls departing from heaven at the
same time were informed with the same idea.
The lover, then, when he beholds the person of
the beloved, sees a form which has been made
more in conformity with the idea than his own
body has; consequently he loves it, and by
refining the visual image of the beloved from
all the grossness of sense, he beholds in it the
idea of his own soul and that of the beloved;
and in the light of this idea he praises the
beloved’s beauty. (VI. 6.) So Spenser:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But they which love indeede, looke otherwise,</div>
      <div class='line'>With pure regard and spotlesse true intent,</div>
      <div class='line'>Drawing out of the object of their eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>A more refyned forme, which they present</div>
      <div class='line'>Unto their mind, voide of all blemishment;</div>
      <div class='line'>Which it reducing to her first perfection,</div>
      <div class='line'>Beholdeth free from fleshes frayle infection.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 214–220.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Here there is no distinction of lover and
beloved; but soon Spenser passes on to consider
the subject from the lover’s standpoint:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And then conforming it unto the light,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which in it selfe it hath remaining still</div>
      <div class='line'>Of that first Sunne, yet sparckling in his sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thereof he fashions in his higher skill,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>An heavenly beautie to his fancies will,</div>
      <div class='line'>And it embracing in his mind entyre,</div>
      <div class='line'>The mirrour of his owne thought doth admyre.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Which seeing now so inly faire to be,</div>
      <div class='line'>As outward it appeareth to the eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with his spirits proportion to agree,</div>
      <div class='line'>He thereon fixeth all his fantasie,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fully setteth his felicitie,</div>
      <div class='line'>Counting it fairer, then it is indeede,</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet indeede her fairenesse doth exceede.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 221–234.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>With a description of the many beauties the
lover sees in the beloved—the thousands of
graces that make delight on her forehead—the
poem ends. (ll. 235–270.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The feature in this theory of Platonism which
appealed to Spenser was the high nature of the
beauty seen in comeliness of form, as explained
by its doctrine of æsthetics. A sense of beauty
as a spiritual quality spreading its divine radiance
over the objects of the outward world
envelops the poem in a golden haze of softened
feeling characteristic of Spenser’s poetic manner.
The scientific terms of the Platonic theorist melt
away into the gentle flow of his verse. The
soul being informed with its idea, as Ficino
had put it, has become in his “Hymne in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Honour of Beautie” that “faire lampe” which
has “resemblence of that heavenly light” of
beauty (ll. 102, 124); or the idea of beauty in
the soul is spoken of as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“the light</div>
      <div class='line'>Which in it selfe it hath remaining still;”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 221–222.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>or, as the lover’s “spirits proportion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In accordance with the same sense of beauty
Spenser in the “Hymne in Honour of Love”
stops to explain away the cruelty which love
seems to show in afflicting him, an innocent
sufferer, by calling attention to the fact that
such suffering is necessary to try the lover’s
sincerity in his worship of so high a thing as
the beauty of his beloved. Love is not physical
desire, but a soaring of the mind to a sight
of that high beauty,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For love is Lord of truth and loialtie,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lifting himselfe out of the lowly dust,</div>
      <div class='line'>On golden plumes up to the purest skie,</div>
      <div class='line'>Above the reach of loathly sinfull lust,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>Unto a fairer forme which now doth dwell</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>In his high thought, that would it selfe excell;</div>
      <div class='line'>Which he beholding still with constant sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Admires the mirrour of so heavenly light.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 179–199.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>And even though the lover may not win the
good graces of his lady, he is happy in the sight
of her beauty.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And though he do not win his wish to end,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet thus farre happie he him selfe doth weene,</div>

      <div class='line'>Fairer then fairest, in his fayning eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose sole aspect he counts felicitye.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 214–220.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Because of this love of beauty, Spenser was
able to find more material in the Renaissance
criticism of Platonic æsthetics for his “Hymne
in Honour of Beautie” than in the corresponding
hymn on love. Besides the conception
of the creative power of love, his “Hymne in
Honour of Love” draws upon a few suggestions
which could dignify the power of the
passion. The saying of Diotima to Socrates in
the “Symposium,”—“Marvel not then at the
love which all men have of their offspring; for
that universal love and interest is for the sake
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>of immortality” (208)—is made to do service
in differentiating the passion of love in men
from that in beasts. By satisfying physical
desire beasts</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“all do live, and moved are</div>
      <div class='line'>To multiply the likenesse of their kynd,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whilest they seeke onely, without further care,</div>
      <div class='line'>To quench the flame, which they in burning fynd:</div>
      <div class='line'>But man, that breathes a more immortal mynd,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not for lusts sake, but for eternitie,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seekes to enlarge his lasting progenie.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 102–109.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Further, to add a sense of mystery to the
nativity of the god of love, Spenser refers to
the myth of Penia and Poros, and also in the
manner of the Platonist tries to reconcile two
contrary assertions about the mysterious nature
of love’s birth. In Diotima’s account of “the
lesser mysteries of love,” she says that love is
the offspring of the god Poros or Plenty, and of
Penia or Poverty. (“Symposium,” 203.) In
Phædrus’s oration on love he began by affirming
that “Love is a mighty god, and wonderful
among gods and men, but especially wonderful
in his birth. For he is the eldest of the gods.”
(“Symposium,” 178.) Agathon, however, differs
from his friend Phædrus in saying that love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>is the youngest of the gods. (“Symposium,”
195.) This disagreement was a source of perplexity
to the Platonist of the Renaissance;
thus Ficino gives a division of his commentary
to a reconciliation of these statements. (V. 10.)
He solves the difficulty by stating that when
the Creator conceived the order of angels, with
whom Ficino identifies the gods of ancient
mythology, the love guiding God was before
the angels, hence is the most ancient of the
gods; but when the created angelic intelligences
turned in their love to the Creator, the
impelling love was the youngest, coming after
the creation of the angels. According to these
notions of the nativity of the god of love,
Spenser opens his “Hymne.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Great god of might, that reignest in the mynd,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the bodie to thy hest doest frame,</div>

      <div class='line'>That doest the Lions and fell Tigers tame,</div>

      <div class='line'>And yet the eldest of the heavenly Peares.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 46–59.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Spenser’s “Hymnes” are the most comprehensive
exposition of love in the light of Platonic
theory in English. The attempt, however,
which he made to place love upon a basis of
philosophic fact is imitated in a much less prominent
way in other poets. Spenser himself refers
to the subject in “Colin Clouts Come Home
Againe.” In that poem Colin unfolds to Cuddy
the high nature of love’s perfection. At the
court, he says, love is the all-engrossing topic
(ll. 778–786); but it is love so shamefully licentious
that its “mightie mysteries” are profaned.
(l. 790.) Love, however, is a religious thing
and should be so conceived. To support this
statement Colin explains the creative power of
love manifest throughout the wide range of
nature (ll. 843–868) and points out that in
man it is a love of beauty. (ll. 869–880).</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few of Jonson’s masques there are slight
attempts to dignify the subject of love in the
manner of Spenser’s “Hymnes.” In “The
Masque of Beauty” love is described as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>creator of the universe, and beauty is mentioned
as that for which the world was created. In
one of the hymns occurs this stanza:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When Love at first, did move</div>
      <div class='line'>From out of Chaos, brightned</div>
      <div class='line'>So was the world, and lightned</div>
      <div class='line'>As now.</div>
      <div class='line in8'><i>1. Echo.</i> As now!</div>
      <div class='line in28'><i>2. Echo.</i> As now!</div>
      <div class='line'>Yield Night, then to the light,</div>
      <div class='line'>As Blackness hath to Beauty:</div>
      <div class='line'>Which is but the same duty.</div>
      <div class='line'>It was for Beauty that the world was made,</div>
      <div class='line'>And where she reigns, Love’s lights admit no shade.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In a second song a reference is made to the
mysterious nativity of love.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“So Beauty on the waters stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>When Love had sever’d earth from flood!</div>
      <div class='line'>So when he parted air from fire,</div>
      <div class='line'>He did with concord all inspire!</div>
      <div class='line'>And then a motion he them taught,</div>
      <div class='line'>That elder than himself was thought.</div>
      <div class='line'>Which thought was, yet, the child of earth,</div>
      <div class='line'>For Love is elder than his birth.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In “Love’s Triumph Through Callipolis” the
same ideas appear. In this masque, after the
band of sensual lovers has been driven from
the suburbs of the City of Beauty (Callipolis),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>and a lustration of the place has followed,
Euclia, or “a fair glory, appears in the heavens,
singing an applausive Song, or Pæan of the
whole.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“So love emergent out of chaos brought</div>
      <div class='line in8'>The world to light!</div>
      <div class='line'>And gently moving on the waters, wrought</div>

      <div class='line in8'>Love’s appetite</div>

      <div class='line'>By virtue of divine intelligence!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In the same masque love is defined in accordance
with the myth of Penia and Poros:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Love is the right affection of the mind,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>So both affections are the union’s cause.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In “Love Freed From Ignorance and Folly”
the sustaining power of love in keeping the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>parts of the universe in concord is used to combat
the accusation that love is mere cruelty.
Love, who is represented as a captive of the
Sphynx, thus replies to the charge:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

</div>

<p class='c007'>A more common appropriation of the teachings
of Platonism was made in the love lyrics—chiefly
the sonnet—written in the Petrarchian
manner. Petrarchism was as much a
manner of writing sonnets as it was a method
of making love. On its stylistic side it was
characterized by the use of antitheses, puns,
and especially of conceits. In the Platonic
theory of love and beauty a certain amount of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>material was offered which could be reworked
into a form suited for the compact brevity of
the sonnet. Sidney, Spenser, and Shakespeare
are the three chief sonnet writers of the last
decade of the sixteenth century in whose
work this phase of Platonism is to be found;
but its presence, though faint, can be felt in
others.</p>

<p class='c007'>One way in which this theory was applied
is found in the manner in which these poets
speak of the beauty of their beloved. Plato
has stated that wisdom is the most lovely of
all ideas, and that, were there a visible image
of her, she would be transporting. (“Phædrus,”
250.) Sidney seizes upon this suggestion, and
by identifying his Stella with wisdom he can
frame a sonnet ending in a couplet that shall
have the required epigrammatic point. He
writes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The wisest scholler of the wight most wise,</div>

<p class='c007'>Shakespeare is able to praise the beauty of
the subject of his sonnets by identifying him
with the absolute beauty of the Platonic philosophy,
and by describing him in accordance
with this notion. Thus he confesses that his
argument is simply the fair, kind, and true, back
of which statement may be inferred the theory
upheld by Platonism that the good, the beautiful,
and the true are but different phases of
one reality. His love, he says, cannot be called
idolatry because his songs are directed to this
theme, for only in his friend are these three
themes united into one.</p>

<p class='c007'>In another sonnet one phase of this argument
is given a detailed treatment, and the poet’s
object is to praise the beauty of his friend by
describing its contrast with the beauty of earth,
just as if he were speaking of absolute beauty.
In this sonnet he uses the Platonic phraseology
of the substance and the shadow, by which he
means first, the reality that makes a thing what
it is, the substance, not the matter or stuff of
which it is made; and second, the reflection of
that reality in the objective world, the shadow
of the substance, not the obscuration of light.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c016'><sup>[10]</sup></a>

were the substance of beauty, beauty absolute,

<p class='c007'>A second tenet of Platonism which was reworked
into English love poetry was its conception

his “Hymne in Honour of Beautie,” true love
has its source in the life of two souls in heaven.
(ll. 200–213.) Drummond uses the idea to
explain the purity of his love.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Vaughan the same theory of love is again
referred to as a proof of the poet’s lofty passion.
In “To Amoret. Walking in a Starry Evening,”
he says that even were her face a distant star
shining upon him, he would be sure of a sympathy
between it and himself, because their minds
were united in love by no accident or chance

<p class='c007'>The end which this conception of making

was thought to be found in a purification of
love. By praising the beauty of the beloved in
such lofty terms the poet was able to set off

mere sensual desire. Thus Spenser testifies to

<p class='c007'>The application of the tenets of Platonic
theory to the writing of love lyrics in the Petrarchian
manner, however, was never anything
more than a courtly way of making love through
exaggerated conceit and fine writing. Fulke
Greville saw clearly the relation between the
love of woman and the love of the idea of her
beauty. In the tenth sonnet of his “Cælica”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>he asks what can love find in a mind where all
is passion; rather he says go back to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in24'>“that heavenly quire</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Nature’s riches, in her beauties placed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there in contemplation feed desire,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which till it wonder, is not rightly graced;</div>
      <div class='line'>For those sweet glories, which you do aspire,</div>
      <div class='line'>Must, as idea’s, only be embraced,</div>
      <div class='line'>Since excellence in other forme enjoyed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is by descending to her saints destroyed.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The love of the idea of beauty, however, in its
absolute nature is nowhere present in the mass
of love lyrics written between 1590 and 1600.
The term is used to give title to Drayton’s
“Idea,” and to denominate the object of twelve
sonnets addressed by Craig to “Idea”; and anagrams
on the French word for the term L’Idée,
Diella and Delia, are used to name two series
of poems by Linche and Samuel Daniel, respectively.
Crashaw’s “Wishes” is addressed to “his
(supposed) mistresse,” as an idea. No better
commentary on the whole movement can be
made than these words of Spenser in which it is
easily seen how the method conduced only to
feeding the lower desires of the soul in love.
Writing in 1596, in the midst of the period
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>when sonnet writing was most popular in England,
he says, speaking of his two “Hymnes”:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Having in the greener times of my youth,
composed these former two Hymnes in the
praise of Love and beautie, and finding that the
same too much pleased those of like age and
disposition, which being too vehemently caried
with that kind of affection, do rather sucke out
poyson to their strong passion, then hony to
their honest delight, I was moved&#160;... to call
in the same. But being unable so to doe, by
reason that many copies thereof were formerly
scattered abroad, I resolved at least to amend,
and by way of retraction to reforme them, making
in stead of those two Hymnes of earthly or
naturall love and beautie, two others of heavenly
and celestiall.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The great representative of Platonism in
English poetry thus condemns the less vital
phase of Platonic thought. The great weakness
of the theory lay in the fact that it had no
moral significance; and just here lay the
great strength of Plato’s ethics. Although
preaching that beauty was a spiritual thing,
this phase of Platonic æsthetics never blended
with the conception of the beauty of moral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>goodness. And it failed to do this because it
is a theory not of Plato but of Plotinus, who
throughout the period of the Renaissance was
understood to expound the true meaning of
Plato’s thought. But Plato left no system of
æsthetics; Plotinus, however, constructed a
theory to account for beauty in its strictest
sense. Now Ficino in his propaganda of Platonic
theory throughout the Renaissance interpreted
Plato’s “Symposium” in the light of
Plotinus and thus in his commentary, the source
of all Renaissance theorizing on love, is found
the theory reflected in the English poets. This
fusion of Plato’s ethics with the æsthetics of
Plotinus was not perfect; and to the deep
moral genius of Spenser’s mind the disparity
soon became evident.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Platonic theory of love had enabled the
English poets to write about their passion as a
desire of enjoying the spiritual quality of beauty
in their beloved. In those poets in whom the
Petrarchistic manner is evident, it is the object
of love on which the attention centres; only in
a slight way did they treat of the nature of love
as a passion. The result of the discussion of
love, as opened by Platonism, ended, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>in an attempt to place love upon a purely
spiritual basis and to write about it as if it were
a psychological fact that was to be known by
analysis. A consideration of beauty, as the
object of love, is absent; attention is directed
to the quality of the passion as one felt in the
soul rather than by the sense; and when the
attraction of woman is present in this love it is
carefully differentiated from the attraction of
sex. In the body of love lyrics written in the
seventeenth century the distinctive traits of
this passion are clearly explained.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief trait of this kind of love is that it
concerns only the soul. The union of the lover
and the beloved is simply a union of their souls
which because of the high nature of the soul can
triumph over time and space. The character of
this union is described in Donne’s “Ecstacy.”
The two lovers are described as sitting in
silence, watching one another. While thus
engaged their souls are so mysteriously mingled
that they are mixed into one greater soul which
is not subject to change. Even when the passion
descends from this height to the plane of
human affections there is no essential change
in the purity of the love.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great value which this purely spiritual

exist as well in the absence of the lovers as in
the presence of both. This thought is a great
comfort and is emphasized as the peculiarity in
the lovers’ passion that sets it apart from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>vulgar kind. Thus Donne in the song, “Soul’s

<p class='c015'>By virtue of this contemplation in love the
passion was freed from any disturbing element

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>In the examples thus far given, the character
of the passion as shared by lover and beloved has
been merely described. There was an attempt
made in some of this poetry to define love as
if it were a something to be analyzed—a product,
as it were, of psychological elaboration.
Vaughan has indicated the two traits in the
love lyrist of the seventeenth century, when he
gives the following title to a lyric,—“To
Amoret, of the Difference ’Twixt Him and
Other Lovers, and What True Love Is.” In
defining “What True Love Is,” the poets show
that it cannot be desire, but is rather an essence
pure in itself, and in one instance it is described
as something unknowable either to sense or
to mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Donne has left a letter in verse “To the
Countess of Huntingdon,” in which he carefully
explains how love cannot be desire. Sighing
and moaning may be love, but it is love made
in a weak way; love should never cast one
down, but should elevate.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Donne in his “Love’s Growth,” there is an
expression of doubt whether his love can be as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>pure as he thought it was, because it seems to
suffer an increase in the spring, and is not a
thing without component elements. But if love
is no quintessence, he says, it must be mixed
with alien passions and thus not be pure. He
silences his doubts, however, by explaining
after the analogy of concentric rings of waves
of water about the centre of disturbance how
his love is one and unelemented.</p>

    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. 39.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This refinement of the subject of love is
carried to an even greater excess. Love is such
a passion that it can be defined only by negatives.
It is above apprehension, because sense
and soul both can know the object of their love.
In the poem of Donne’s “Negative Love,” in
which this idea is expressed, it is probable that
the poet has in mind the description of The
One which Plotinus outlines in the “Enneads.”
Summing up his discussion of The One, or The
Good, in which he has pointed out how it is
above intellect, Plotinus says: “If, however,
anything is present with <i>the good</i>, it is present
with it in a way transcending knowledge and
intelligence and a cosensation of itself, since it
has not anything different from itself....
On this account says Plato [in the “Parmenides,”
speaking of <i>the one</i>] that neither language
can describe, nor sense nor science apprehend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>it, because nothing can be predicated of it as
present with it.” (“Enneads,” VI. vii. 41.)
Transferring this idea of the transcendency of
The One to his love, Donne had the form of
thought for his lyric.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I never stoop’d so low, as they</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>This reference to the knowledge of self also
occurs in Plotinus in the preceding sentence
to the passage already extracted. “For the
mandate,” he says, “‘know thyself,’ was delivered
to those, <i>who, on account of the multitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>which they possess</i>, find it requisite to enumerate
themselves, and in order that by knowing
the number and quality of the things contained
in their essence, they may perceive that they
have not a knowledge of all things, or, indeed,
of anything [which they ought to know], and
who are ignorant over what they ought to rule,
and what is the characteristic of their nature.”
(VI. vii. 41.)</p>

<p class='c007'>This highly metaphysical conception of love,
the character of which has been shown in a few
selected examples, became in the course of
time known as “Platonic Love.” Scattered
throughout the lyric poetry of the seventeenth
century may be found certain poems labelled
“Platonic Love.” Their presence among the
author’s work is no testimony whatsoever that
it is colored by any strain of Platonism, but
merely signifies that at one time in his career
the poet wrote love lyrics according to the
prevailing manner of the time. For about
1634 Platonic love was a court fad. Howell,
writing under date of June 3, 1634, says: “The
Court affords little News at present, but that
there is a Love call’d Platonick Love which
much sways there of late: it is a Love abstracted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>from all corporeal gross Impressions
and sensual Appetite, but consists in Contemplations
and Ideas of the Mind, not in any
carnal Fruition. This Love sets the Wits of
the Town on work; and they say there will be
a Mask shortly of it, whereof Her Majesty and
her Maids of Honour will be part.”<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c016'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The masque referred to is D’Avenant’s “The
Temple of Love” (1634). In Thomas Heywood’s
“Love’s Mistress or the Queen’s Masque” (1640)
the myth of Cupid and Psyche is interpreted in
accordance with the notion of Platonic love;
and in D’Avenant’s “Platonick Lovers” (1636)
the subject of Platonic love is ridiculed. It is
probable that the rise of this custom at the court
was due to the presence of Henrietta Maria, the
queen of Charles I. Margaret of Valois had
made Platonic love known in France; and had
shown how licentiousness of conduct was compatible
with its practice. “She had a high
harmonious soul,” writes Howell,<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c016'><sup>[13]</sup></a> “much addicted
to music and the sweets of love, and
oftentimes in a Platonic way; She would have
this Motto often in her mouth; <i><span lang="fr">Voulez vous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>cesser d’aymer? possedez la chose aymée.</span></i>...
She had strains of humors and transcendencies
beyond the vulgar, and delighted to be call’d
<i>Venus Urania</i>.” It is probable that the young
queen wished to follow such an example and
made known to the English court this new
way of love gallantry. The practice of making
love in the Platonic way grew so popular
at any rate as to become a question of serious
discussion. John Norris says, “<i>Platonic Love</i> is
a thing in every Bodies Mouth,” and after comparing
it with the love described by Plato in
the “Symposium,” he concludes, “But why
this should be call’d by the name of <i>Platonic</i>
Love, the best reason that I know of, is because
People will have it so.”<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c016'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Algernon Sidney has
left an account of love as a desire of enjoying
beauty. He concludes that since man is midway
between angels and beasts, his love will
share in the peculiarities of both the celestial
and the sensual passion.<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c016'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Walter Charleton
ridicules the subject and unmasks its immorality,
although his purpose is not in any way to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>purify the morals of his readers.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c016'><sup>[16]</sup></a> Robert Boyle
wrote, but did not publish, a series of letters,
“wherein [among other subjects] Platonic love
was explicated, celebrated, and wherein the cure
of love was proposed and prosecuted.”<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c016'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The ideas expressed in these poems on Platonic
love are not essentially different from
those in the lyrics which have been already
discussed. At times, as in Stanley’s “Love’s
Innocence,” the Platonic manner is understood
as one devoid of all danger. It was in this
way that Vaughan looked upon his love for
Amoret. “You have here,” he says, “a
flame, bright only in its own innocence, that
kindles nothing but a generous thought, which
though it may warm the blood, the fire at
highest is but Platonic; and the commotion,
within these limits, excludes danger.”<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c016'><sup>[18]</sup></a> On the
other hand, Carew’s “Song to a Lady, not yet
Enjoyed by her Husband,” shows how the stock
ideas was used to cloak the immorality of the
poet’s thought. George Daniel has left a series
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>of poems revealing the several phases of this love
ranging between the two extremes. He writes
one “To Cinthia, coying it,” in which its innocence
is preached. “To Cinthia Converted”
describes the union of the two souls. “To
the Platonicke Pretender” warns the ladies
from listening to this love when taught by
a libertine. “Pure Platonicke” explains the
spiritual nature of the passion by contrast with
sensual love. “Court-Platonicke” shows how
at court it was used merely as a means to an
improper end. “Anti-Platonicke” recites the
feelings of the sensual lover.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c016'><sup>[19]</sup></a> In Lord Herbert
are found two other phases of this love. The
first and second of his poems named “Platonick
Love” are complimentary poems addressed to a
lady; the first, telling her how the love inspired
by her refines his soul, and the second celebrating
Platonic love in general application.</p>

    </div>

      <div class='line'>They would a Being in themselves project,</div>
      <div class='line'>Since infinites as they yet never did,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor could conclude without some good effect.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(Stz. 16.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Platonic love, as such an example proves, was
but synonymous with hopeless love.</p>

<p class='c007'>Platonic love, then, meant either a love devoid
of all sensual desire, an innocent or hopeless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>passion, or it was a form of gallantry used
to cloak immorality. Its one characteristic
notion was that true love consisted in a union
of soul with soul, mind with mind, or essence
with essence. This idea of restricting love to
the experience of soul as opposed to the enjoyment
of sense is the one notion which runs beneath
many of the love lyrics written in the
seventeenth century; and it is the point attacked
by opponents. In John Cleveland, “To
Cloris, a Rapture,” and in Campion’s “Song”<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c016'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
the poets exhort their beloved to enjoy this
high union of soul. In Carew’s “To My Mistress
in Absence,” in Lovelace’s “To Lucasta.
Going beyond the Seas,” and in Cowley’s
“Friendship in Absence,” the triumph of love
over time and space is explained by the mingling
of souls in true love. In Sedley’s “The
Platonick” and in Ayres’s “Platonic Love”
are found examples of the hopelessness of the
passion. In Aytoun’s “Platonic Love” which
was taken by Suckling to form a poem—the
“Song,” beginning, “If you refuse me once”—the
lover modestly confesses that he cannot
rise to the heights of such a pure passion, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>requests a more easy way. In Cleveland’s
“The Anti-Platonick” and “Platonick Love,”
in Brome’s “Epithalamy,” in Cowley’s “Platonick
Love” and “Answer to the Platonicks,”
and in Cartwright’s “No Platonique Love,” the
claims of the opponents are expressed in all the
grossness of Restoration immorality.</p>

<p class='c007'>The atmosphere in which the metaphysical
treatment of love flourished was intensely intellectual.
The poets in whom the strain is
clearest were trying to accomplish two thing:
they wished to oppose the idea of passion in
love, and they endeavored to account for the
attraction of sex in the love which they themselves
experienced. However much these poets
wished to exclude the notion of sex, their minds
were constantly busied in trying to solve the
source of its power. In Donne, the greatest
representative of the metaphysical manner, this
purpose is very evident. He wrote his longest
poem, “An Anatomy of the World,” to
show how, by reason of the death of a certain
young woman, “the frailty and the decay of
this whole world is represented.” In reply to
Jonson’s criticism, that this poem was “full of
blasphemies,” Donne remarked that “he described
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>the Idea of a Woman, and not as she
was.”<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c016'><sup>[21]</sup></a> Here lies the secret of Donne’s treatment
of woman; he was interested in her,
not as a personality, but as an idea. In solving
the nature of this idea he recurred to certain
Platonic conceptions by which he thought to
explain the source of her power.</p>

<p class='c007'>These Platonic conceptions are two. Woman
is identified with virtue; she is the source of
all virtue in the world, others being virtuous
only by participating in her virtue. Thus in a
letter “To the Countess of Huntingdon” he
shows how virtue has been raised from her
fallen state on earth by appearing in woman.
She was once scattered among men, but now
summed up in one woman.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If the world’s age and death be argued well</div>
      <div class='line in2'>By the sun’s fall, which now towards earth doth bend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then we might fear that virtue, since she fell</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So low as woman, should be near her end.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But she’s not stoop’d, but raised; exiled by men</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She fled to heaven, that’s heavenly things, that’s you;</div>
      <div class='line'>She was in all men thinly scatter’d then,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But now a mass contracted in a few.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“She gilded us, but you are gold; and she</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Informed us, but transubstantiates you.</div>
      <div class='line'>Soft dispositions, which ductile be,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Elixirlike, she makes not clean, but new.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Though you a wife’s and mother’s name retain,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>’Tis not as woman, for all are not so;</div>
      <div class='line'>But virtue, having made you virtue, is fain</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To adhere in these names, her and you to show.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Else, being alike pure, we should neither see;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As, water being into air rarefied,</div>
      <div class='line'>Neither appear, till in one cloud they be,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So, for our sakes, you do low names abide.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Beneath this torture of conceits may be seen
the idea that woman is that very virtue of
which Plato has spoken in his “Phædrus.”
Sidney has used the idea to compliment Stella;
but Donne’s purpose is to show how woman, as
woman, is to be identified with it, and that the
differentiation in the concept resulting from
the fact that she may be a wife or a mother is
due to the necessity that this virtue become
visible on earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second Platonic conception through
which Donne conveys his idea of woman’s
nature is the universal soul. In his lyric, “A
Fever,” he says, speaking of the object of his
love:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>“But yet thou canst not die, I know;</div>
      <div class='line'>To leave this world behind, is death;</div>
      <div class='line'>But when thou from this world wilt go,</div>
      <div class='line'>The whole world vapours with thy breath.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Or if, when thou, the world’s soul, go’st</div>
      <div class='line'>It stay, ’tis but thy carcase then.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>And in “An Anatomy of the World” this idea
of the death of the world in the death of a
woman is explained at length.</p>

<p class='c007'>Holding thus to this idea of woman, and striving
to differentiate love from passion, Donne
was able to confine his notion of love to the
soul; and through the metaphysical manner of
his poetic art he was able to express this notion
in the most perplexing intricacies of thought.
As Dryden has said, “he affects the metaphysics,
not only in his satires, but in his amorous
verses, where nature only should reign: and
perplexes the minds of the fair sex with the
speculations of philosophy, where he should
engage their hearts, and entertain them with
the softness of love.”<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c016'><sup>[22]</sup></a> By imitating his style
the other lyric poets of the seventeenth century
produced the species of love poems which have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>already been analyzed. His skill and his sincerity
of aim are lacking in their verse; and
the result was either a weak dilution of his
thought or a striving for his manner in praising
a lower conception of love.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c012'>I. NATURE OF GOD</h3>

<p class='c013'>Platonism affected Christian theology as it
appears in English poetry in a twofold way.
It provided a body of intellectual principles
which were identified with the persons of the
Christian Trinity and it also trained the minds
of the poets in conceiving God rather as the
object of the mind’s speculative quest than as
the dread judge of the sinful soul. Platonism
in this form is no longer the body of ethical
principles appearing in the Platonic dialogues;
but is that metaphysical after-growth of Platonism
that has its source in the philosophy of
Plotinus. According to this form of speculative
mysticism there were three ultimate principles,
or hypostases,—The Good, Intellect (υοῦς),
and Soul. Owing to the affinity of Platonism
for Christian forms of thought, these three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>hypostases were conceived as the philosophic
basis underlying the Christian teaching of the
three Persons of the Trinity. Such an interpretation
is seen plainly in the work of Henry
More and William Drummond; and the speculative
attitude of conceiving God and Christ in
the light of the hypostases of Plotinus is also
discernible in Spenser and Milton.</p>

<p class='c007'>The boldest attempt to identify the three
Plotinian principles with the Christian Trinity
is made in Henry More’s “Psychozoia,” the
first poem of his “Psychodia Platonica.” This
poetical treatise reveals the aim of More’s
spiritual life as it was formulated on the basis
of Platonic philosophy blended with the teaching
of the “Theologia Germanica.” The
strain of self-abnegation which More learned in
“that <i>Golden little Book</i>,”<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a> as he names the
German treatise, may be easily separated from
the Platonism, being confined to the last two
books of his poem; it may thus be dismissed.
In the first book, however, the current of
thought is almost purely Platonic. There,
under the figure of the marriage rite, the first
principle of Plotinus, the Good, is represented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>as joining his two children—Intellect and
Soul—in holy union; and under the poetic
device of a veil with several films or tissues,
More describes Soul in minute detail.</p>

<p class='c007'>In keeping with the teachings of Platonism
More defines each person of the Trinity in the
terms used by Plotinus. According to this
philosopher the highest reality is The One or
The Good which is infinite and above all comprehension,
not because it is impossible to
measure or count it (since it has no magnitude
and no multitude), but simply because it is impossible
to conceive its power. (“Enneads,” VI.
ix. 6.) In the beatific vision, in which The Good
is known in the Soul, it is invisible, hidden in its
own rays of light. (“Enneads,” VI. vii. 35.)
More thus speaks of God, naming him Hattove:</p>

      <div class='line'>“Th’ Ancient of dayes, sire of <i>Æternitie</i>,</div>

      <div class='line'>Who puts to silence every daring tongue</div>

<p class='c007'>The Son is identified with the second hypostasis,—universal
intellect. In this all realities
are present not as created things in time or
space, but embraced as essential forms with no
spatial or temporal relation. This character of
universal intellect is thus named αἰών, or eternity.
(“Enneads,” III. vii. 4.) More thus
writes of Christ—</p>

<p class='c007'>Psyche, or Uranore, as she is named at times,
is the third person of the Trinity. She is the
soul of the universe, present in every “atom
ball,” in the creatures of earth, sea, air, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>divine stars in heaven. (“Enneads,” V. i. 2.)
In her true essence she is invisible; but More
pictures her as enveloped in a fourfold garment.
The outer garment is called Physis,
in which all natural objects appear as spots
which grow each according to its idea. This
robe is stirred with every impulse of life from
the central power of God.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second and third folds of Psyche’s vest
are very closely identified. They are called
Arachnea and Haphe, by which the life of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>sensation is meant. Haphe, or touch, sits in
the finely spun web of Arachnea, and is aware
of every manifestation of life resulting from
the soul’s contact with the outward world.
In this life of sensation Psyche sees as in a
mirror all the stirring life within the universe.
(I. 48, 49, 50.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The fourth fold of Psyche’s garment is
called Semele, by which imagination is meant.
This is the loosest of the four veils, having the
fullest play in its movements. It is universal
imagination, and from it arises the inspiration
of the poet and the prophet. (I. 57.) The
individual powers of imagination are conceived
as daughters of the one great Semele.</p>

<p class='c007'>These three persons—Ahad, another name
given by More to God (I. 34), Æon, and Psyche—form,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>says More, “the famous Platonicall
Triad; which though they that slight the
Christian Trinity do take for a figment; yet I
think it is no contemptible argument, that the
Platonists, the best and divinest of Philosophers,
and the Christians, the best of all that

</div>

<p class='c015'>In this way More has expressed his conception
of the Christian Trinity. Inasmuch as his
purpose in the “Psychozoia” is to relate the
experiences of the human soul from the time
of its departure from God to its return thither,
he has laid especial emphasis upon the third
hypostasis of Plotinus,—Soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>In William Drummond’s “An Hymn of the
Fairest Fair” attention is centred upon the
first person of the Trinity. Drummond is
more of a poet and less of a philosopher than
More; but the philosophic conceptions which
are woven into his poetical description of the
nature, attributes, and works of God are drawn
from the same system of metaphysics. In
Drummond’s “Hymn” there is a mingling of
two conceptions of God. He is described, according
to the Hebraic idea, as a mighty king,
the creator of the universe, dwelling in heaven,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>and possessing such attributes of personality
as justice, mercy, might. Running in and out
of this description is a strain of Platonic speculation,
in which the conception of God as an
essence is very prominent. Thus by means
of a poetic device picturing youth standing before
God and pouring immortal nectar into His
cup, Drummond expresses the Platonic idea of
absolute oneness. And this idea is the attribute
of God first set forth.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If so we may well say (and what we say,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here wrapt in flesh, led by dim reason’s ray,</div>
      <div class='line'>To show by earthly beauties which we see,</div>
      <div class='line'>That spiritual excellence that shines in thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>Good Lord, forgive), not far from thy right side,</div>
      <div class='line'>With curled locks Youth ever doth abide;</div>
      <div class='line'>Rose-cheeked Youth, who, garlanded with flowers</div>

      <div class='line'>And, as ends and beginnings thee not claim,</div>
      <div class='line'>Successionless that thou be still the same.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 31–42.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After a description of God’s might, Drummond
passes on to consider His truth, conceived
as the Platonists conceived intellect,
embracing all reality as essential form. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>attribute is pictured as a mirror in which God
beholds all things.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“With locks in waves of gold that ebb and flow</div>

      <div class='line'>Truth steadfastly before thee holds a glass,</div>
      <div class='line'>Indent with gems, where shineth all that was,</div>
      <div class='line'>That is, or shall be. Here, ere aught was wrought,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou knew all that thy pow’r with time forth brought,</div>
      <div class='line'>And more, things numberless which thou couldst make,</div>
      <div class='line'>That actually shall never being take:</div>
      <div class='line'>Here, thou behold’st thyself, and, strange, dost prove</div>
      <div class='line'>At once the beauty, lover, and the love.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 56–66.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Platonic metaphysics are also present in
Drummond’s account of the essential unity
persisting throughout the triplicity of Persons.
Plotinus had held that The One caused
the mind or intellect, and that in turn caused
universal soul. The order, however, is not
one of time sequence, but merely a logical order
of causation. In this series of causation there
is no idea of a production as an act going out
of itself and forming another; each producing
cause remains in its own centre; throughout the
series runs one cause or manifestation of life.
His favorite figures by which he explains this
idea are, first, that of an overflowing spring
which gives rise to a second and this to a third;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>and, second, that of a sun with a central source
of light with its spreading rays. (“Enneads,”
V. ii. 1, 2.) Thus intellect is an irradiation of
The One and soul is an irradiation of intellect.
(“Enneads,” V. i. 6.) Drummond, holding to
the idea of the self-sufficiency of God as expressed
in Plotinus, a state in which God is
alone by Himself and not in want of the things
that proceed from Him (“Enneads,” VI. vii.
40), is thus able to unfold the mystery of the
One in Three:</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>From this point on to the close, the “Hymn”
celebrates the glory of God in his works.
Drummond possessed an imagination that delighted
as Milton’s did in the contemplation of
the universe as a vast mechanical scheme of sun
and planets. (ll. 180–232.) His philosophic
mind, however, led him to conceive of nature
in the manner of the Platonists. God, or true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>being, according to Plotinus is a unity, everywhere
present (“Enneads,” VI. v. 4); and
matter, the other extreme of his philosophy, is
an empty show, a shadow in a mirror. (“Enneads,”
III. vi. 7.) In closing the account of
the works of God, Drummond thus writes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Whole and entire, all in thyself thou art,</div>

      <div class='line'>If sever’d from the substances them cast?”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(ll. 285–298.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Drummond’s “Hymn” is the work of a mind
in which poetical sensuousness and philosophic
abstraction are well-nigh equally balanced. In
More the philosopher had outweighed the poet.
In Milton the poet asserts his full power. To
him the Plotinian scheme of the hypostases is
valuable only as they enable his love of beauty
to be satisfied in conformity with his intellectual
apprehension of the relation between God
and the Son in the Trinal Godhead. Plotinus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>had outlined the relation between The Good and
Intellect as that of a principle of beauty by
which the intellect is invested and possesses
beauty and light. (“Enneads,” VI. vii. 31.) The
Good itself is the principle of beauty, hidden
in its own rays of light. In Milton the conception
of God as hidden in inaccessible light,
and of the Son as the express image of the
invisible beauty of God, is explained in conformity
with the Platonic scheme, and also with
those Scriptural texts, one of which mentions
God as a King of kings, who only hath immortality,
dwelling in the light which no man
can approach unto (1 Tim. vi. 16); and the
other proclaims that in Christ “dwelleth all the
fulness of the Godhead bodily” (Col. ii. 9).
Thus in heaven the angels hymn their praises:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>

    <div class='attrib'>(VI. 680–682.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>This relation of Christ to God which in the
Scripture was indicated only as in an outline
sketch has been filled in with the substance of
the Plotinian æsthetics, in which The One and
The Good is beauty itself (καλλονή) and intellect
is the beautiful (τὸ καλόν). (“Enneads,”
I. vi. 6.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The attraction which this philosophical explanation
had for those whose work reveals its
presence is twofold. To the religious mind in
which the metaphysical cast of thought was
prominent, the idea of the transcendent immanence
of God in all things as their life, yet apart
from all things as objects in time and space
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>came home with its wealth of suggestion of the
nearness of God to man. In Henry More this
feeling is uppermost in his “Psychozoia.” In
the midst of his description of Psyche’s robe
he breaks out into a passage on the constant
care which God shows toward the world. In
Psyche’s mirror of Arachnea and Haphe God
is aware of all on earth that falls under sense.
The roaring of the hungry lion, the burning
thirst of the weary traveller and every movement
of the little sparrow are all known to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>In those minds less metaphysical in nature,
the high speculations of Platonic philosophy
opened a way by which they could conceive
God as a principle grasped by the mind rather
than as a personal judge and punisher of sin.
In Drummond this contrast in the two conceptions
of God—one feeding itself on philosophy,
and the other on the imagery of the
Scripture—is strikingly brought out by a comparison
of the opening and the ending of “An

<h3 class='c012'>II. NATURE OF THE SOUL</h3>

<p class='c013'>The nature of the soul from the standpoint
of Plotinian metaphysics was treated by Henry
More in his two poetical treatises, “Pyschathanasia”
and “Anti-psychopannychia.” In the
former he follows the course of the argument
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>set forth in the seventh book of the fourth
“Ennead” of Plotinus. In the Plotinian defence
two propositions are established; namely, that
the soul is not body, and that it is not a function
of body. By demonstrating these, it followed
that the soul is an immaterial thing,
a real being, and consequently eternal. This
is the drift of More’s argument in “Psychathanasia.”
The first and second books are devoted
to the establishment of the definition of the soul
as an incorporeal substance, and the proof of its
incorporeality is deduced from considerations
of its functions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The soul, More holds, is an incorporeal thing
because it is a self-moving substance present
in all forms of life. Plotinus had taught that
soul was everywhere. “First, then,” he says,
“let every soul consider this: how by breathing
life into them soul made all animals, the
creatures of earth, sea, air, the divine stars in
heaven; made the sun, made the great firmament
above us, and not only made but ordered
it, so that it swings round in due course. Yet
is this soul a different nature from what it
orders, and moves, and vivifies. It must needs
then be more precious than its creations. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>they are born, and when the soul which ministers
their life abandons them, they die; but the
soul ever is because it never abandons itself.”
(“Enneads,” V. i. 2.) More finds this soul present
in the growth of all forms of vegetation, the
sphere spermatic (I. ii. 30), in the life of animals,
sensation, and self-directed motion; and
in the intellectual life of man. (I. ii. 17–22.)</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thus have I trac’d the soul in all its works,</div>
      <div class='line'>And severall conditions have displaid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And show’d all places where so e’r she lurks,</div>
      <div class='line'>Even her own lurkings of her self bewray’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>In plants, in beasts, in men, while here she staid.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. ii. 23.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He next demonstrates that this soul is a
self-moving substance. It is self-moving in
plants, as the quickening power of the sun
on vegetation shows. Through the heat of
the sun the hidden centre, or soul, is called
into the life of blossoming and growth.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thus called out by friendly sympathie</div>
      <div class='line'>Their souls move of themselves on their <i>Centreitie</i>.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. ii. 31.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In animals the self-moving soul is manifested
in motion and the life of sensation.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Then be the souls of beasts self-moving forms,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bearing their bodies as themselves think meet,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Invited or provok’d, so they transform</div>
      <div class='line'>At first themselves within, then straight in sight</div>
      <div class='line'>Those motions come, which suddenly do light</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon the bodies visible, which move</div>
      <div class='line'>According to the will of th’ inward spright.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. ii. 36.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In man the self-motion of the soul is present
in the activity of reason, whether as the presiding
power in all of the operations of the
image-making faculty, or as the contemplative
and speculative power. (I. ii. 41–44.)</p>

<p class='c007'>After this account of the nature of the soul
as a self-moving substance, More addresses
himself to the task of showing that all life is
immortal. In a time of despondency a Nymph
once came and declared to him,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>All life’s immortall</i>: though the outward trunk</div>
      <div class='line'>May changed be, yet life to nothing never shrunk.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. iii. 17.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>According to the theory unfolded by the
Nymph there is an ever present unity in all
things which is the true source of their life.
This is God. From Him are six descending
degrees of existence, called intellectual, psychical,
imaginative, sensitive, plantal, or spermatic.
(I. iii. 23.) Below all of these is
matter, which is nothing but mere potentiality,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>or the possibility of all created things.
(I. iv. 9.) Though these various degrees of
life are distinct, they are manifestations of the
one pervading unity. (I. iii. 25.) Matter thus
cannot be the prop and stay of life. (I. iii. 26.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The second proof of the incorporeal nature
of the soul is found in the character of its
functions. After a hasty attack on the doctrine
of materialism in the form of a <i><span lang="la">reductio
ad absurdum</span></i> (II. ii. 13–25; cf. Plotinus,
IV. vii. 3), More shows, first, that the faculty
within us by which we are aware of the outward
world of sense is one and individual, yet
everywhere present in the body. (II. ii. 32.)
This faculty, called “the common sense”
(II. ii. 26), sits as judge over all the data of
sense knowledge (cf. Plotinus, IV. vii. 6); it
decides in case of disagreement between two
senses, and distinguishes clearly between the
objects present to each sense. (II. ii. 28.)
The common sense must be one, else, being
divided, it would breed confusion in consciousness
(II. ii. 31); and it must be everywhere
present in the body because it shows no partiality
to any sense, but has intelligence of all
equally. (II. ii. 32.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>The rational powers of the soul are a further
proof of the soul’s incorporeal nature. The
first consideration draws attention to the vast
scope of man’s will and soul. In the virtuous
the soul can be so universalized and begotten
into the life of God that the will embraces all
with a tender love and is ever striving to seek
God as the good. (II. iii. 6.) If this is so,
More asks whether the soul thus universalized
can ever die. (II. iii. 7.) Man’s understanding,
too, can become so broadened that it can
apprehend God’s true being, not knowing it, to
be sure, in its true essence, but having such
a true insight that it can reject all narrow conceptions
of His nature and welcome other more
comprehensive ideas as closer approximations
to the truth. The understanding is in a state
that More calls parturient; God under certain
conditions can be born within the soul. (II. iii.
9–12.) For the reason, then, of the vastness of
the power of will and understanding More holds
that the soul cannot be a body. (II. iii. 4.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The next argument in regard to the rational
powers of the soul centres about her power of
pure abstraction. (Cf. “Enneads,” IV. vii. 8.)
In herself the soul divests matter of all time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>and place relations and views the naked, simple
essence of things. (II. iii. 18.) She thus
frames within herself an idea, which is indivisible
and unextended; and by this she judges outward
objects. (II. iii. 18–20; cf. “Enneads,”
IV. vii. 12.) This property is not a property
of body. (II. iii. 26.)</p>

<p class='c007'>At this point More closes the first division of
his argument. By establishing the definition
of the soul as a self-moving substance, and by
an account of the nature of its functions, he has
defended his first proposition, that the soul is
an incorporeal thing. He then passes on to the
second part of his argument, that the soul is an
incorporeal thing because it is independent of
the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>This portion of his defence falls into four
main divisions. In the first he explains the
nature of the body’s dependence upon the soul.
Through the power that the soul has by virtue
of its lowest centre of life, called the plantal,
the soul frames the body in order to exercise
through it the functions of life. (III. i. 17.)
The more perfect this body is the more awake
the soul is. (III. i. 17.) But after the work of
framing the body is finished, the soul dismisses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>it as an old thought and begins its life of contemplation.
(III. i. 16.) The main desire is
to see God. (III. ii. 11.) Next More shows
how the soul can direct her own thoughts
within herself without in any way considering
the body. Her intellectual part dives within
her nature in its quest for self-knowledge and
her will affects herself after this knowledge has
been gained. All this is accomplished free
from any bodily assistance. (III. ii. 25, 26.)
The third division shows how the soul is so
independent of the body that she can resist its
desires. Often the sensual impulse of our
nature would lead us to be content with mere
satisfaction of our bodily desires; but the soul
desirous of truth and gifted with an insight
into God’s true nature enables us to resist all
such impulses. (III. ii. 38, 39.) The fourth
division contrasts the vitality of the soul with
that of sense, fancy, and memory. These three
faculties are weakened by age and by disease,
and also by excessive stimulation; but the soul
never fades, but grows stronger with each contemplative
act. (III. ii. 48, 49, 56.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The attraction which the philosophy of
Plotinus had for More’s mind lay in its scheme
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>of speculative mysticism. The metaphysical system
of Plotinus had taught that The One, which
is the truly existing being, is everywhere present
and yet nowhere wholly present. (“Enneads,”
VI. iv.) It had explained also that the only
way in which the individual soul could apprehend
this truly existing being was by a mystical
union with it, in which state the soul did not
know in the sense of energizing intellectually,
but was one with The One. (“Enneads,” VI.
ix. 10.) These two ideas lie at the basis of
More’s theosophic mysticism. Their presence
can be felt throughout his “Psychathanasia”
as its controlling idea and also in his two less
important treatises, “Anti-psychopannychia”
and “Anti-monopsychia.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The argument of the “Anti-psychopannychia”
and of the “Anti-monopsychia” centres
about the doctrine of the mystic union with
God. The argument in the “Psychathanasia”
is a critique of materialism rather than a positive
plea for the existence of the soul after
death. It was the purpose of More in his two
pendants to his longer poem to treat of the
state of the soul after death. That it is not
enveloped in eternal night he proves in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“Anti-psychopannychia.” His argument is
briefly this: Since God is a unity everywhere
present, he is infinite freedom. (II. 2.) Since
the soul’s activities of will and intellect are
free from dependence upon the body, death
will be but the ushering of the soul into the
life of God’s large liberty.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Wherefore the soul cut off from lowly sense</div>
      <div class='line'>By harmlesse fate, far greater libertie</div>
      <div class='line'>Must gain: for when it hath departed hence</div>
      <div class='line'>(As all things else) should it not backward hie</div>
      <div class='line'>From whence it came? but such divinitie</div>
      <div class='line'>Is in our souls that nothing lesse than God</div>
      <div class='line'>Could send them forth (as Plato’s schools descrie)</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherefore when they retreat a free abode</div>
      <div class='line'>They’ll find, unlesse kept off by <i>Nemesis</i> just rod.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. 14.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In this life of union the soul will realize the
deep fecundity of her own nature; for in her
are innate ideas. To establish this theory of
innate ideas into which Plato’s theory of reminiscence
has been transformed in Plotinus (cf.
“Enneads,” IV. iii. 25), More educes four considerations.
They must exist because (1) like
is known only by like (II. 31); (2) no object or
number of objects can give the soul a universal
concept (II. 36); (3) the apprehension of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>incorporeal things cannot be made by sense,
therefore the soul must have the measure of
such within her own nature (II. 38, 39); and
(4) the process of learning shows that it is education,
or the drawing out of the mind what
was in it potentially (II. 42). Inasmuch, then,
as innate ideas exist within the mind, called
out by experience in life, how much more will
they be evoked in that high union with God!</p>

      <div class='line'>“But sith our soul with God himself may meet,</div>

</div>

<p class='c007'>But this union of the soul with The One may
be thought to obliterate self-identity after death
and teach only a universal absorption of all souls
into The One. To combat this idea More contends
in his “Anti-monopsychia” that by virtue
of the “Deiformity” of the soul, by which he
means its ability to be joined with God, the
soul in death is so</p>

    <div class='attrib'>(Stz. 35, 36.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the “Psychathanasia” the Plotinian doctrines
of the immanent unity of The One and
of the mystical union of the soul with it are
not so much present as positive arguments incorporated
in the sequence of thought, but are
felt as controlling ideas in the mind of the
writer. The reason for this lies in the fact
that in the argument of Plotinus (IV. vii)
these two truths of his philosophy are not
specifically elaborated. To More, however, as
indeed to all students of Plotinian metaphysics,
these are the significant ideas of his system.
More thus brings them in at opportune times
throughout his argument in “Psychathanasia.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The conception of the ever present unity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>The One in all things is the fundamental idea
in the first division of his thought. The tenacity
with which he clings to this doctrine is
remarkable. His argument had brought him
to the point where he had shown that all life—of
plants and animals, as well as of men—was
immortal. What, then, is the state of the
plantal and animal soul after death? (I. ii.
49–53.) More does not answer directly, but
replies that although men cannot know this,
it is not permitted to reason it down.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But it’s already clear that ’tis not right</div>
      <div class='line'>To reason down the firm subsistencie</div>
      <div class='line'>Of things from ignorance of their propertie.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. ii. 59.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Consequently when he comes to consider man’s
immortality, he says that all the preceding
argument—the general reflection on the “self-motion
and centrall stabilitie” of the soul—may
be dismissed as needless.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“Onely that vitalitie,</div>
      <div class='line'>That doth extend this great Universall,</div>

      <div class='line'>Of great and little worlds, that keep in memorie.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. i. 7.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>It is because of the firm conviction with which
he holds to the conception of the pervading
unity of The One that he expands the idea at
length in the third and fourth cantos of the
first book.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second idea, that of the mystical union of
the individual soul with The One, is an incentive
to More’s thought and feelings throughout
the course of his entire argument. From the
fact that the soul can dive as deep as matter,
and rise to the height of a blissful union with
God, he derives the necessary inspiration for
his “mighty task.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“This is the state of th’ ever-moving soul,</div>

    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(I. ii. 8.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>When in the course of his argument he arrives
at a discussion of the rational power of the
soul, he launches out into a treatment of the
vast scope of man’s will and mind which</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“should bring forth that live Divinity</div>

    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. iii. 12, 13.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Again, when his argument brings him to the
point at which the independence of soul from
body is to be proved, he breaks out with an
exclamation of the bliss of that union of soul
with God, when</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“reason shines out bright,</div>
      <div class='line'>And holy love with mild serenity</div>

    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(III. ii. 28.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>and passes on to a description of The One as
seen in the vision</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Unplac’d, unparted, one close Unity,</div>

      <div class='line'>Eternal rest, joy without passing sound.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(III. ii. 36.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Finally in the last canto of his third book he
testifies to the vanity of that knowledge of
the reasons for the soul’s immortality, even as
he had given them (III. ii. 11), and confesses
that the only sure stay in the storm of life is a
faith in “the first Good.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But yet, my Muse, still take an higher flight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sing of Platonick Faith in the first Good,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Faith that doth our souls to God unite</div>

      <div class='line'>The prop and stay of things is Gods benignity.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(III. iv. 14.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As in his “Psychozoia” it was noted how the
omnipresence of Psyche appealed to More’s
religious sense of the nearness of God to His
children, so in his other treatises, especially his
“Psychathanasia,” the mystical union of the
soul with The One is for More another name
for the love of God as known in the soul of the
Christian. The Christian religion had taught
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>that God is love, a conception far removed
from Platonism, whether of the dialogues or of
the “Enneads” of Plotinus. But the tendency
to find in Platonism a rational sanction for
religious truth was so strong in the theology
of the Cambridge school, to which More belonged,
that this conception of God as love—which,
indeed, is held by the Christian not as
an idea but as a fact of his inmost religious
experience—was interpreted in the light of
the speculative mysticism of Plotinus; and
thus the formless One, the ultra-metaphysical
principle above all being, became the Christian
God of love.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>III. ETERNITY OF THE SOUL AND OF MATTER</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the work of Vaughan and Spenser two
distinct phases of another form of Platonic
idealism are presented: one in which the poet
looks back upon eternity as a fact of the soul’s
past experience, and the other in which he
directs a forward glance to the future when the
soul shall find its eternal rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the expression of his sense of eternity,
Vaughan recurs to the doctrine of the preëxistence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>of the soul as it is expounded in Plato.
In Vaughan this idea is felt as an influence
either affording the substance of his thought or
determining the nature of his imagery. The
idea which Vaughan carries over into his
own poetry is found in Plato’s account in the
“Phædrus” of the preëxistence of the soul in
a world of pure ideas before its descent into the
body. “There was a time,” says Plato, “when
with the rest of the happy band they [<i>i.e.</i> the
human souls] saw beauty shining in brightness:
we philosophers following in the train of
Zeus, others in company with other gods; and
then we beheld the beatific vision and were
initiated into a mystery which may be truly
called most blessed, celebrated by us in our
state of innocence, before we had any experience
of evils to come, when we were admitted
to the sight of apparitions innocent and simple
and calm and happy, which we held shining in
pure light, pure ourselves and not yet enshrined
in that living tomb which we carry about, now
that we are imprisoned in the body, like an
oyster in his shell.” (“Phædrus,” 250.)</p>

<p class='c007'>This idea occurs in two forms in Vaughan.
In “The Retreat” the reminiscence of a past
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>is described as a fact of Vaughan’s religious
experience. He longs to travel back to the
time when, in his purity, he was nearer to God
than he is now in his sinful state.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Happy those early days, when I</div>
      <div class='line'>Shin’d in my angel-infancy!</div>
      <div class='line'>Before I understood this place</div>
      <div class='line'>Appointed for my second race,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or taught my soul to fancy ought</div>
      <div class='line'>But a white, celestial thought;</div>
      <div class='line'>When yet I had not walk’d above</div>
      <div class='line'>A mile or two from my first love,</div>
      <div class='line'>And looking back—at that short space—</div>
      <div class='line'>Could see a glimpse of His bright face;</div>
      <div class='line'>When on some gilded cloud, or flow’r,</div>
      <div class='line'>My gazing soul would dwell an hour,</div>
      <div class='line'>And in those weaker glories spy</div>
      <div class='line'>Some shadows of eternity;</div>
      <div class='line'>Before I taught my tongue to wound</div>
      <div class='line'>My conscience with a sinful sound,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or had the black art to dispence</div>
      <div class='line'>A sev’ral sin to ev’ry sense,</div>
      <div class='line'>But felt through all this fleshly dress</div>
      <div class='line'>Bright shoots of everlastingness.</div>
      <div class='line'>O how I long to travel back,</div>
      <div class='line'>And tread again that ancient track!</div>
      <div class='line'>That I might once more reach that plain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where first I left my glorious train:</div>
      <div class='line'>From whence th’ enlighten’d spirit sees</div>
      <div class='line'>That shady City of palm-trees.</div>
      <div class='line'>But ah! my soul with too much stay</div>
      <div class='line'>Is drunk, and staggers in the way!</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Some men a forward motion love,</div>
      <div class='line'>But I by backward steps would move;</div>
      <div class='line'>And when this dust falls to the urn,</div>
      <div class='line'>In that state I came, return.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The second form of this idea appears in
Vaughan’s poem called “Corruption.” Man
is represented as enjoying the happiness of
innocence in the garden of Eden, where he
was in close touch with the beauties of heaven.
Here he had a glimpse of his heavenly birth;
but when, by reason of sin, he was forced to
leave that place, he found earth and heaven no
longer friendly.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sure, it was so. Man in those early days</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Was not all stone and earth;</div>
      <div class='line'>He shin’d a little, and by those weak rays</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Had some glimpse of his birth.</div>
      <div class='line'>He saw heaven o’er his head, and knew from whence</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He came, condemnèd, hither;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as first love draws strongest, so from hence</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His mind sure progress’d thither.</div>
      <div class='line'>Things here were strange unto him; sweat and till;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>All was a thorn or weed.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>       ·       ·       ·       ·       ·</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>This made him long for home, as loth to stay</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With murmurers and foes;</div>
      <div class='line'>He sigh’d for Eden, and would often say</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘Ah! what bright days were those!’</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor was heav’n cold unto him: for each day</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The valley or the mountain</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Afforded visits, and still Paradise lay</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In some green shade or fountain.</div>
      <div class='line'>Angels lay leiger here: each bush, and cell,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Each oak, and highway knew them;</div>
      <div class='line'>Walk but the fields, or sit down at some well,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And he was sure to view them.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In this poem, although there is no such parallelism
with the account of a preëxistent state
as it is given in Plato, the fundamental idea
is the same as that of “The Retreat.” Vaughan
describes man’s life in Eden as one of closer intimacy
with his celestial home than his lot on
earth affords him, just as he had described the
experience of his own “angel-infancy” and its
contrast to his earthly life. In both poems is
present the conviction that the human soul once
lived in a state of pure innocence; and in both
is heard the note of regret at the loss of this
through sin.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Vaughan’s poem, “The World,” the influence
of Plato’s account of the preëxistent
life of the soul is felt only in affording the
character of the imagery which Vaughan has
used to express his idea. In the “Phædrus”
Plato describes the progress of the soul in its
sight of the eternal ideas in the heaven of
heavens. Each soul, represented as a charioteer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>guiding a pair of winged horses, is carried
about by the revolution of the spheres,
and during the progress it beholds the ideas.
The souls of the gods have no difficulty in seeing
these realities; “but of the other souls,”
says Plato, “that which follows God best and
is likest to him lifts the head of the charioteer
into the outer world, and is carried round in
the revolution, troubled indeed by the steeds,
and with difficulty beholding true being; while
another only rises and falls, and sees, and again
fails to see by reason of the unruliness of the
steeds. The rest of the souls are also longing
after the upper world, and they all follow, but
not being strong enough they are carried round
below the surface, plunging, treading on one
another, each striving to be first; and there is
confusion and perspiration and the extremity
of effort; and many of them are lamed, or have
their wings broken, through the ill-driving of
the charioteers.” (“Phædrus,” 248.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In this account of the revolution of the soul
about the eternal realities of true being, Vaughan
found the suggestion for his poem, “The World.”
Instead of the revolution of the soul about true
being, he describes the revolution of time about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>eternity. The figure of the charioteer is absent,
too, but it is by the use of the “wing” that
those who make the revolution about eternity
mount up into the circle, just as in Plato. Time
in the poem also is represented as being “driven
about by the spheres.” Such coincidences of
imagery show that Vaughan found in Plato’s
fanciful account of the soul’s preëxistent life
in heaven the medium through which he expressed
his view of the relation of the life of
the present day world to that of eternity. At
first he pictures the revolution of the world
about the great ring of light which he calls
eternity:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I saw Eternity the other night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a great ring of pure and endless light,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>All calm, as it was bright;</div>
      <div class='line'>And round beneath it, Time in hours, days, years,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Driv’n by the spheres</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a vast shadow mov’d: in which the world</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And all her train were hurl’d.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>He then describes the lover busied in his trifles,—his
lute, his fancies, and his delights. Next
moves the statesman, pursued by the shouts of
multitudes. The next to follow are the miser
and the epicure.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Spenser finds his suggestion of the eternal in
life, not in a consciousness of a past existence,
but in a conception of the world of matter built
up in accordance with the Platonic doctrine
of stability of the substance amid the flux of
changing forms. This conception of the world
is explained by him in his description of the
“Garden of Adonis” in the “Faerie Queene”
and in his “Two Cantos of Mutabilitie.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The conception of matter which Spenser
teaches is the doctrine of Plotinus expressed in
accordance with the account of flux and stability
of natural phenomena explained by Plato
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>in the “Timæus.” According to Plotinus
matter is an indestructible “subject” of forms
which endures through all the various changes
which it is constantly undergoing, and this
unchanging something is never destroyed.
(“Enneads,” II. iv. 6.) In the “Timæus” Plato
had outlined a theory of flux with which this
doctrine of the indestructibility of matter could
be easily harmonized. In his discussion of the
world of natural phenomena he distinguishes
three natures, as he calls them, and likens them
to a father, a child, and a mother. “For the
present,” he says in the “Timæus” (50), “we
have only to conceive of three natures: first,
that which is in process of generation; secondly,
that in which the generation takes place; and
thirdly, that of which the thing generated is a
resemblance. And we may liken the receiving
principle to a mother, and the source or spring
to a father, and the intermediate nature to
a child.” According to this piece of poetic
imagery he describes the various manifestations
of matter in the outward world. The elements
are constantly changing in and out of one
another and have in them nothing permanent.
They cannot be called “this” or “that,” but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>only “such.” Only the receiving principle,
the universal nature, “that must be always
called the same; for while receiving all things,
she never departs at all from her own nature,
and never in any way or at any time assumes
a form like that of any of the things which
enter into her; she is the natural recipient of
all impressions, and is stirred and informed by
them, and appears different from time to time
by reason of them.” (“Timæus,” 50.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The explanation of the myriad changes of
matter of the outward world of sense after the
manner of this account by Plato is found in
Spenser’s description of the “Garden of Adonis.”
The term “garden of Adonis” is found in
Plato’s “Phædrus” (276), where is meant an
earthen vessel in which plants are nourished
to quick growth only to decay as rapidly. On
this term Spenser’s imagination built its superstructure
of fancy by which the garden of
Adonis became symbolic of the world of natural
phenomena described after the manner of
Plato in the “Timæus” and Plotinus in the
“Enneads.” The garden is described at first
as a seminary of all living things, conceived first
as flowers:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“In that same Gardin all the goodly flowres,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherewith dame Nature doth her beautifie,</div>
      <div class='line'>And decks the girlonds of her paramoures,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are fetcht: there is the first seminarie</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all things, that are borne to live and die,</div>
      <div class='line'>According to their kindes. Long worke it were,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here to account the endlesse progenie</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all the weedes, that bud and blossome there;</div>
      <div class='line'>But so much as doth need, must needs be counted here.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(III. vi. 30.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Spenser’s imagination now changes, and he
conceives of the objects in this garden as naked
babes, in accordance with the suggestion of the
intermediate nature which Plato conceived as
a child. Genius as the porter of the place is
thus described:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He letteth in, he letteth out to wend,</div>
      <div class='line'>All that to come into the world desire;</div>
      <div class='line'>A thousand thousand naked babes attend</div>
      <div class='line'>About him day and night, which doe require,</div>
      <div class='line'>That he with fleshly weedes would them attire:</div>
      <div class='line'>Such as him list, such as eternal fate</div>
      <div class='line'>Ordained hath, he clothes with sinfull mire,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sendeth forth to live in mortall state,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till they againe returne backe by the hinder gate.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(III. vi. 32.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Again there is a change, and the objects issuing
from this garden are forms which borrow
their substance from the matter of chaos.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>“Infinite shapes of creatures there are bred,</div>
      <div class='line'>And uncouth formes, which none yet ever knew,</div>
      <div class='line'>And every sort is in a sundry bed</div>
      <div class='line'>Set by it selfe, and ranckt in comely rew</div>
      <div class='line'>Some fit for reasonable soules t’ indew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Some made for beasts, some made for birds to weare,</div>

      <div class='line'>That seem’d the <i>Ocean</i> could not containe them there.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(III. vi. 35.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>When these forms are sent forth from the
garden they take for their substance the matter
found in chaos which is ever eternal.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Daily they grow, and daily forth are sent</div>

      <div class='line'>Yet is the stocke not lessened, nor spent,</div>

      <div class='line'>As it at first created was of yore.</div>
      <div class='line'>For in the wide wombe of the world there lyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>In hateful darkenesse and in deepe horrore,</div>
      <div class='line'>An huge eternall <i>Chaos</i>, which supplyes</div>
      <div class='line'>The substances of natures fruitfull progenyes.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“All things from thence doe their first being fetch,</div>

      <div class='line'>Which when as forme and feature it doth ketch,</div>

      <div class='line'>But chaunged is, and often altred to and fro.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(III. vi. 36–37.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Spenser now stops the play of fancy and
becomes the philosopher, explaining the doctrine
of matter as taught by Plotinus. The
substance of things is eternal and abides in
potency of further change.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The substance is not changed, nor altered,</div>
      <div class='line'>But th’ only forme and outward fashion;</div>
      <div class='line'>For every substance is conditioned</div>
      <div class='line'>To change her hew, and sundry formes to don,</div>
      <div class='line'>Meet for her temper and complexion:</div>
      <div class='line'>For formes are variable and decay,</div>
      <div class='line'>By course of kind, and by occasion;</div>
      <div class='line'>And that faire flower of beautie fades away,</div>
      <div class='line'>As doth the lilly fresh before the sunny ray.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(II. vi. 38.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Finally, Spenser closes his account of the
garden with a mingling of fancy and philosophy.
He adopts the suggestion of Plato that
the source of the many changes in natural
phenomena is a father, and blends the conception
with the myth of Venus and Adonis. In
the garden Venus is represented as enjoying
the pleasure of the presence of Adonis perpetually,
for he is described as the father of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>the various forms who abides eternal in all
change.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There wont faire <i>Venus</i> often to enjoy</div>
      <div class='line'>Her deare <i>Adonis</i> joyous company,</div>
      <div class='line'>And reape sweet pleasure of the wanton boy;</div>
      <div class='line'>There yet, some say, in secret he does ly,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lapped in flowers and pretious spycery,</div>
      <div class='line'>By her hid from the world, and from the skill</div>
      <div class='line'>Of <i>Stygian</i> Gods, which doe her love envy;</div>
      <div class='line'>But she her selfe, when ever that she will,</div>
      <div class='line'>Possesseth him, and of his sweetnesse takes her fill.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And sooth it seemes they say: for he may not</div>
      <div class='line'>For ever die, and ever buried bee</div>
      <div class='line'>In balefull night, where all things are forgot;</div>
      <div class='line'>All be he subject to mortalitie,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet is eterne in mutabilitie,</div>
      <div class='line'>And by succession made perpetuall,</div>
      <div class='line'>Transformed oft, and chaunged diverslie:</div>
      <div class='line'>For him the Father of all formes they call;</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore needs mote he live, that living gives to all.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(III. vi. 46, 47.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The attraction which this doctrine of the
indestructibility of matter had for Spenser lay
in the comforting assurance which it brought
him of an eternity when things should be at
rest. Throughout Spenser is heard a note of
world weariness.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='attrib'>“Nothing is sure, that growes on earthly ground.”</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>These words placed in the mouth of Arthur
(I. ix. 11) are essentially characteristic of
Spenser’s outlook on the things of this world:
they are his <i>lacrimæ rerum</i>. The “Cantos of
Mutabilitie” is the best instance in point.
These two cantos celebrate the overthrow of
Mutability by Nature. To the claim of preëminence
among the gods which Mutability lays
before Nature, and which she bases upon the
fact that everything in the wide universe is subject
to constant change, Dame Nature replies that
though they be subject to change, they change
only their outward state, each change working
their perfection; and she further remarks that
the time will come when there shall be no more
change. At the end of Mutability’s plea Dame
Nature thus answers the charge:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I well consider all that ye have sayd,</div>
      <div class='line'>And find that all things stedfastnes doe hate</div>
      <div class='line'>And changed be: yet being rightly wayd</div>
      <div class='line'>They are not changed from their first estate;</div>
      <div class='line'>But by their change their being doe dilate:</div>
      <div class='line'>And turning to themselves at length againe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Doe worke their owne perfection so by fate:</div>
      <div class='line'>Then over them Change doth not rule and raigne;</div>
      <div class='line'>But they raigne over change, and doe their states maintaine.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>“Cease therefore daughter further to aspire,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thee content thus to be rul’d by me:</div>
      <div class='line'>For thy decay thou seekst by thy desire;</div>
      <div class='line'>But time shall come that all shall changed bee,</div>
      <div class='line'>And from thenceforth, none no more change shall see.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(VII. vii. 58, 59.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>On this decision of Nature Spenser bases his
assurance of a time when the soul shall have
its final rest. With a prayer to the great God
of Sabaoth that he may see the time when all
things shall rest in Him, Spenser closes his
work on his great unfinished poem—the
“Faerie Queene.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Then gin I thinke on that which Nature sayd,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of that same time when no more <i>Change</i> shall be,</div>
      <div class='line'>But stedfast rest of all things firmely stayd</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon the pillours of Eternity,</div>
      <div class='line'>That is contrayr to <i>Mutabilitie</i>:</div>
      <div class='line'>For, all that moveth, doth in <i>Change</i> delight:</div>
      <div class='line'>But thenceforth all shall rest eternally.</div>
      <div class='line'>With Him that is the God of Sabbaoth hight:</div>
      <div class='line'>O Thou great Sabbaoth God, graunt me that Sabaoths sight.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(VII. viii. 2.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the theory of the preëxistence of the soul
and in the conception of the indestructibility of
matter Vaughan and Spenser were able to find
teachings which were akin to the most intimate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>experiences of their lives. Although the phase
of Platonic idealism which taught in these two
distinct ways the eternity of human life and of
the world about us did not have so vital an influence
upon English poetry as did the opening
of a world of moral beauty, its presence is nevertheless
indicative of the strong hold which Platonism
had upon some of the finest poetic minds
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in
England. Even when these poets were writing
from the fulness of their own personal experience,
it was in the moulds of Platonic philosophy
that their thought was cast.</p>

<p class='c007'>The elements of Platonism, then, that enter
into the English poetry of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, have their source in the
dialogues of Plato and the “Enneads” of Plotinus.
The body of this teaching—its æsthetics,
its metaphysics, and its ethics—was seen by the
poets in its relation to Christian doctrine and
to the passion of romantic love. The more
permanent results for good are found in the
fusion of Platonism with the ideals of Christian
living and with its longing for perfection. If
one passage in Plato may adequately sum up
the teaching of Platonism most influential in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>English poetry, it is the passage in “Phædrus”
in which the beauty of wisdom is taught
(“Phædrus,” 250).</p>

<p class='c007'>But beauty in its stricter import is a thing
known to the sense, and is carried over into the
moral world only to indicate the value of moral
ideas. Plato recognized this; and in this connection
it is significant that in the part of
“Phædrus,” where he speaks of the loveliness
of wisdom, he is aware of the power of pure
beauty. “But of beauty,” he says, “I repeat
again that we saw her there [in the ideal world]
shining in company with the celestial forms;
and coming to earth we find her here too, shining
in clearness through the clearest aperture of
sense. For sight is the most piercing of our
bodily senses; though not by that is wisdom
seen; her loveliness would have been transporting
if there had been a visible image of her,
and the other ideas, if they had visible counterparts,
would be equally lovely. But this is the
privilege of beauty, that being the loveliest she
is also the most palpable to sight” (250).</p>

<p class='c007'>Spenser was the poet who caught the spirit
of this teaching. Pastorella’s beauty is presented
not as Una’s, the beauty of wisdom, nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>as Britomart’s, the beauty of the inward purity
of womanhood; but it is a beauty of pure form.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And soothly sure she was full fayre of face,</div>
      <div class='line'>And perfectly well shapt in every lim,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which she did more augment with modest grace,</div>
      <div class='line'>And comely carriage of her count’nance trim,</div>
      <div class='line'>That all the rest like lesser lamps did dim.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(VI. ix. 9.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>And yet as she stands on the little hillock she
is encompassed with a cloud of glory.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Upon a litle hillocke she was placed</div>
      <div class='line'>Higher then all the rest, and round about</div>
      <div class='line'>Environ’d with a girland, goodly graced,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of lovely lasses, and them all without</div>
      <div class='line'>The lustie shepheard swaynes sate in a rout;</div>
      <div class='line'>The which did pype and sing her prayses dew,</div>
      <div class='line'>And oft rejoyce, and oft for wonder shout,</div>
      <div class='line'>As if some miracle of heavenly hew</div>
      <div class='line'>Were downe to them descended in that earthly vew.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='attrib'>(VI. ix. 8.)</div></div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>They saw in the object before their eyes the
idea of beauty in earthly form. The miracle
is no more and no less than this; it is “the
privilege of beauty, that being the loveliest she
is also the most palpable to sight.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. ll. 470–475 are taken from “Phædo,” 81: “And this corporeal
element, my friend, is heavy and weighty and earthy,
and is that element of sight by which a soul is depressed
and dragged down again into the visible world, because she
is afraid of the invisible and of the world below—prowling
about tombs and sepulchres, near which, as they tell us, are
seen certain ghostly apparitions of souls which have not departed
pure, but are cloyed with sight, and therefore visible.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. Besides paraphrasing “Phædo,” 110–111 in ll. 111–136,
Drummond repeats the argument given in that dialogue to
prove the probable existence of such a world. Cf. ll. 141–170
with “Phædo,” 109.—“But we who live in these
hollows [of earth] are deceived into the notion that we are
dwelling on the surface of the earth; which is just as if a
creature who was at the bottom of the sea were to fancy
that he was on the surface of the water and that the sea
was the heaven through which he saw the sun and the other
stars, he having never come to the surface by reason of his
feebleness and sluggishness, and having never lifted up his
head and seen, nor ever heard from one who had seen, how
much purer and fairer the world above is than his own....
[But] if any man could arrive at the exterior limit [of the
atmosphere], or take the wings of a bird and come to the
top, then like a fish who puts his head out of water and sees
this world, he would see a world beyond.”</p>

and the reference to a true and painted chair are

figure of the three beds. (“Republic” X, 597–599.)</p>
